<pre>&gt; While mogilefs can be considered a &quot;file system,&quot; it's not a file system
&gt; like one you'd put on a hard disk or an SD card. First, it's accessed

Indeed technically mogilefs is not a file system in the sense that we
are used to. However, the general term for this sort of thing, so far
as I can tell, seems to be &quot;distributed file systems.&quot; Even mogilefs
refers to itself as a &quot;distributed file system.&quot; In fact I don't
actually care much what it's called. I am just trying to use the same
name that everyone else does.

&gt; My very strong recommendation is that you, for the moment at any
&gt; rate, drop the idea of using a distributed file system, and instead
&gt; of describing a proposed (and probably poor) solution to an unknown
&gt; problem, instead describe the problem itself. It's almost certain that
&gt; a &quot;distributed file system&quot; in the sense of something like NFS either
&gt; won't work well for you or be rather insecure or both.

Good point. In fact, if there is a reasonable way to do it that does
not involve a distributed file system, or whatever you want to call
it, I would be very interested in that as well.

There is a web application, in fact a few applications, which take a
input from a large number of users. These are not system users of
course, but web users. Much of this data goes into a database, which
is not a problem. There are a lot of associated files, which are at
least 95% images, but there are also mp3s, flvs, and some misc text
files. There may also be other stuff that I am not aware of.

This is, thankfully, mostly stored in a single location with a
directory structure based off a dates. For example:
~/files/something/2010/2/10/something/something/myfile.png

Mostly this is just write and forget. But there are some cases where
there are deletes and edits (the text files).

The updates have to be replicated to the other servers fairly quickly.
I.E. I don't want to use cron or something triggering a script.

NFS: I refuse to use NFS for anything under any circumstances. In
fact, it's best not to talk about NFS in front of me. Think Happy
Gilmore.


&gt; By the way, I'd lay greater than 50% odds that you'd be best served by a
&gt; version control system.

That is interesting. The code itself is managed that way as part of a
deployment process (we'll just add the remote servers into the same
process). It seems a bit strange to me to use version control for
something that doesn't have any versioning.

How would you invision that working exactly? Someone uploads a file,
and it triggers a merge? I guess with git I could see how that might
be possible, but wouldn't it be sexier if I just new that every write
was being written to the other servers, and the was something in place
tracking this against the nodes?

Certainly some of you out there have had to deal with this sort of
problem before and I think it's an interesting subject. How have the
rest of you addressed this sort of problem before?

Cheers,
Sach
