&gt;     Scott&gt; Recently, I began using aterm
&gt; 
&gt; What's aterm, I mean, is it part of a group of more or less related
&gt; apps, like the e- series?  Most important, is it dependent on GNUMB or
&gt; KiDding-mE?  If so, there are probably IM-related tweaks I don't know
&gt; about, and all of the below may be irrelevant.

Originally designed for AfterStep users, it's based on rxvt.  Supposedly
its advantage is that it's designed for faster transparency (which I
don't use) and also, supposedly, not tied to AfterStep or (according to
FreeBSD pkg-descr) not tied to any libraries.


&gt;     Scott&gt; Next, I tried building it in Arch Linux.  After reading the
&gt;     Scott&gt; README.config I chose --enable-kanji.  However, when called
&gt;     Scott&gt; it with my langx script, I get a white box towards the
&gt;     Scott&gt; bottom of the screen where I can input the kanji.  However,
&gt;     Scott&gt; after inputting kanji nothing appeared in aterm.
&gt; 
&gt; You might want to publish the langx script (again, if you did it
&gt; before).

My apologies--so many newcomers wind up getting sent to my pages on
inputting Japanese that I got lazy.  (Should add that one of my earliest
mentors got me in the habit of ending script names with an x rather than
.sh)

In Arch 

#!/bin/bash
XMODIFIERS=&quot;@example.com=kinput2&quot; LC_CTYPE=ja_JP ${1+&quot;$@&quot;} &amp;

The script varies from distribution (and O/S, eg Net and FreeBSD) but
this works in Arch with rxvt.
&gt; 
&gt; This sounds like it's probably an X Input Method (XIM) issue.  XIM is
&gt; an excessively complex and even so inadequate standard.  :-(  There are
&gt; several possible problems.
&gt; 
&gt; (1) You need to have an input manager (traditionally kinput2 for
&gt; Japanese) and often a backend processor (eg, Wnn or Canna) running _at
&gt; startup_ of the *term.  Recent apps may know how to get them started,
&gt; but it's not part of the XIM standard, and can't work seamlessly in a
&gt; distributed environment, so most apps don't try.


No, both are already running.  (I see I left out various information
that I should have put in the original post, I'll answer them in
line--that is one of things I should have mentioned).
&gt; 
&gt; (2) You need to have the Unix environment set up correctly.  This
&gt; means the LANG, LC_ALL, or (usually) LC_CTYPE variables, which are set
&gt; to implementation-dependent locale strings.  It _may_ matter whether
&gt; you set it to &quot;ja&quot;, &quot;ja_JP&quot;, or &quot;ja_JP.eucJP&quot; (or other Japanese-
&gt; capable encoding), and I have seen installations where ja_JP worked
&gt; but neither ja nor ja_JP.eucJP worked (notwithstanding that kinput2
&gt; and Canna were configured to generate EUC-JP!)


As mentioned above, ja_JP works in Arch.  (Sidebar--in FreeBSD 4.x it
was ja_JP.EUC in 5.x it's ja_JP.eucJP--that might work in 4.x as well,
but ja_JP.EUC doesn't work in 5.x)
&gt; 
&gt; You must also have the XMODIFIERS variable set correctly.

Heh, did Jonathan tell you about the day I sent a grouchy email about
how it didn't work in Deb, to send an abashed one 20 minutes later
because I'd typed XMODIFIRES?

The langx script works with rxvt.
&gt; 
&gt; (3) You want to have the X environment set up.  One of the
&gt; unnecessarily complex aspects of XIM is the setup of the IM's UI.
&gt; You can do input on the root window, in a dedicated subwindow of the
&gt; app, or &quot;over&quot; the spot, all of which basically create a window for
&gt; XIM to use as a sandbox, or you can do &quot;on&quot; the spot input, in which
&gt; case the app must provide callbacks to XIM to help it draw the text.
&gt; 
&gt; It sounds to me like you need to set a resource in aterm to get it to
&gt; use over-the-spot preediting.  Here's the doc for the corresponding
&gt; resource in KTerm (no guarantee that Aterm will call it the same
&gt; thing, unfortunately---look in the /usr/X11R6/lib/app-defaults/Aterm
&gt; file on the distros that work; nb, capitalization of ATerm may vary).

Ok, that is a start (don't have time to do it at this instant, going to
work, but that is one place I haven't looked)
&gt; 
&gt;    preeditType (class PreeditType)
&gt;        Specifies  the input styles using XIM protocol in the form of a
&gt;        comma separated list.  Currently, ?$B!F!FOverTheSpot?$B!G!G and  ?$B!F!FRoot?$B!G!G
&gt;        are supported.  The default is ?$B!F!FOverTheSpot,Root.?$B!G!G
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think this has anything to do with getting aterm to accept
&gt; input, though.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     Scott&gt; In general, I usually just set LC_CTYPE to Japanese.
&gt; 
&gt; AFAIK language names are an implementation-dependent extension; try
&gt; the POSIX-style &quot;ja&quot;, &quot;ja_JP&quot;, and &quot;ja_JP.eucJP&quot; as well.

I will try playing with that as well.  I thought it wouldn't be
relevant, however, as rxvt does give proper input.  (I think that's
something else I neglected to mention in my original post).

&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Of course, since you know it works in Debian, why not just switch?&quot;

Because Arch is a nice new distro with fewer packages and less
stability, so let's throw it on all the mission critical servers.  :)

Because ~everything~ &quot;just works&quot; in Deb, which is boring.  

Thank you, as always.
 
You've given me something to check.  In NetBSD, with rxvt one
has to tweak the app-defaults/Rxvt file to get it to work (though they
tell you this at installation).
