&gt; 
&gt; Hello
&gt; 
&gt; I am a new user of linux (Suse professional 9.0). I bought this version
&gt; because of the linux versions, several websites said it was one of a few
&gt; that did English and japanese and that the YAST feature made it easy to
&gt; install and download programs without having to learn to use terminal
&gt; programs. Having been frustrated with Windows, buying a new machine (with
&gt; a serial ATA drive that Windows 2000 didn't like), and being told that
&gt; Linux was much more stable, I took the plunge.

To answer your last question first, yes, this probably is the wrong
forum.  This list is more for the technically oriented, those who like
researching these things.

&gt; 
&gt; But I am stuck.  Having installed Linux in English and then trying to
&gt; activate Japanese, I have only managed to get Kana but no Kanji.

Hopefully, someone familiar with SuSE will be able to give a better
answer, but you should be able to activate a program called cannaserver.
I don't know how SuSE determines what programs run at boot, hopefully,
someone will see this and answer, so that you can run it at bootup.  It
shouldn't be complex.

I've never tried to get Japanese going in Knoppix.  It's usually not
that hard to get Japanese working in Linux, at least to a point.
However, there are a few commands that have to be done.

I realize you want it to just work.  I have page about inputting
Japanese in various distributions--of course, SuSE isn't really covered
as I haven't used it in a long time, but perhaps it might be of
use--it'll be a bit more reading than you feel like doing, but it's
actually not that complex.  I like to think that my page is helpful to
the beginner as well.  It's at

<A  HREF="http://home.nyc.rr.com/computertaijutsu/jpninpt.html">http://home.nyc.rr.com/computertaijutsu/jpninpt.html</A>

It also covers (albeit with some commands) one of your preferences, that
of having the ability to input Japanese with English menus.


I'm surprised that it doesn't. (Dr Fabian, are you still here?)  RedHat
starts cannaserver at boot even if you install in English with Japanese
support.
&gt; 
&gt; I really wanted it to work without having to &quot;try this and try that&quot;.
&gt; I had hoped for the best of both worlds, like installing in Japanese but
&gt; getting English menus, like is possible with Windows 2000.  That way I
&gt; could enter the occasional Japanese but have the easier to understand
&gt; English menus.


It is quite possible.  It's a bit more complicated than MS or Mac, but
not overly so.  


&gt; WHAT I HOPE FOR
&gt; ---------------
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; (3) Since I want a system that I don't have to become a Linux guru to
&gt; use--I just want to enjoy myself and get some work done---should I opt for
&gt; a DIFFERENT distribution?  I see that Knoppix is listed as easy and as
&gt; doing Japanese.  It says that it is SLOW to run from the CD, but it is
&gt; unclear if one can also install from the CD.   I like Suse's Yast because
&gt; i do not have to enter arcane commands.

I am tempted to say try RedHat.  It makes Japanese input easy (but SuSE
should as well).  You can install in English and simply choose to add
Japanese support during installation. 

&gt; 
&gt; (4) Can I just put a CD or DVD of any good installation and write over
&gt; it?  It seems that I can do that with Suse---that is what I   have been
&gt; doing at least.   (I have been tempted to go back to Windows 2000, but
&gt; have been told it is not easy to get rid of Linux and then go back to
&gt; another operating system...I never left a partition for Windows.....so
&gt; unless i throw out my entire hard drive, I think I am stuck with this--or
&gt; if it is not a problem---just buying another CD of another company's
&gt; Linux.


Yes, you can install over it--during installation 
&gt; 
&gt; (5) If this is the wrong forum for these questions, please tell me. I
&gt; don't want to waste anyone's time. I enetered SUSe in the serach engine
&gt; and could not find any post.  I see some other japanese related forums,
&gt; and I do not want to spent most of my time thinking about or learning the
&gt; intricasies of Linux---just want it to work with less trouble than
&gt; Windows.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance
