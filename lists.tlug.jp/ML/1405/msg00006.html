&gt; The upgrade from Saucy (13.10), itself being an upgrade from Raring (13.04)

&gt; To start with, I upgraded from Gnome Classic.


Sorry to hear that.  I've upgraded from 13.10 to 14.04 several times
(&gt;5) in the last month with no major problems.  I even did one from
12.04 LTS and it went fine.  I actually do use Unity on all systems so
maybe such differences might be the reason.


&gt; So I wonder what to do. Retry with a fresh install? The problem is all these
&gt; files changed weeks after week on the system itself (example: fail2ban,
&gt; Google postfix, www, encrypted disks, etc...). My guess is that I would go
&gt; for a 1-3 days work to get something working. If I want to cleanup also my
&gt; home directory, this will be very long too (creating a new one). This
&gt; unfortunately needs a new uid, as cron cannot manage correctly 1 uid with 2
&gt; users for some stupid reasons. So many things to take care about, that I
&gt; have no more motivation anymore.


Oh, correction.  I did have a problem with one upgrade with how the
window manager was starting up.  I created a fresh login name and
confirmed that there was no problems with that.  This means it was one
of my settings in my home directory.  So, I copied my data files over
and erased that one.  Yes, that means all of my favourite settings
were gone, but it didn't take days to rectify.

Before panicking, perhaps like me, you should probably confirm that it
is a problem with the installation and not the settings in your home
directory.

As for your system files, you can copy everything in /etc somewhere
and then do a fresh install and copy the files back that differ.
Surely most files don't differ.

So files, like what's in fail2ban, wouldn't hurt to start from the
beginning with a fresh history of banned IP addresses.


&gt; I have full daily backups, so I will find everything. But having 145
&gt; directories in my home (I use 10 max), not knowing what is useful and for
&gt; what (not speaking about subdirectories, such as .config or .gconf, which
&gt; alone have 615 files (regular I mean, potentially important).


You sound like you're overreacting a bit.  Which I could understand, I
guess.  Calm down and get some sleep.  :-)

When you're awake again and thinking clearly, then try to fix your
system.  It is probably easier to start from a fresh login and copy
useful files over than removing useless files from your own directory.
 But if you insist on the latter, then if you don't know what it is,
just erase it.  What matters is your data files...whatever work you've
done or e-mails you've written.  Preferences for software can be set
again...no big deal.  And these are generally the .* files.  To play
it safe, move files between logins so that if you missed something,
you can always grab it later.


&gt; I don't have motivation to start it again, and put back the hidden
&gt; configuration files as soon as I discover them (it will take 6 months or 1
&gt; year, and even never sure nothing has been forgotten).
&gt;
&gt; If I do, what would be your advice?


Advice?  Seriously...get some sleep before doing anything further!
:-)  With the aforementioned problem I had with my home directory's
settings where I copied my own files over, it took an hour or two.
I'm not sure where you're getting 6 months or 1 year...
