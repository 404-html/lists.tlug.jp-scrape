wrote:<BR>"There are several differences between the MacBook and the MacBook Pro 
you should take into account"<BR><BR>Joe:<BR>Thanks especially to Niel for the 
message in which he explained the differences between the MacBook and MacBook 
Pro, but also to everyone else.&nbsp; The comments and advice, given right away, 
helped me make a good, quick decision.&nbsp; I went with the MacBook Pro because 
I ne...ne...ne...neeeeeed the cool graphics!&nbsp; (Give me another shot 
quick!)&nbsp; No, actually, one thing that I heard from the Mac sales rep. was 
that the Pro has a nice screen, with less of a glare than the regular 
MacBook.&nbsp; One can choose from a regular screen, or a "clear" screen when 
ordering a MacBook Pro.&nbsp; And the "clear" screen is the one that's less 
clear, the rep. explained to me.&nbsp; If you want a clear screen, don't order a 
"clear" (kuriaa) screen, stupid!&nbsp; Order the regular one, which is a "matte" 
screen.&nbsp; Whatever...<BR><BR>Niels' explanation was much more helpful than 
the sales rep's explanation, as one would expect.&nbsp; Some additional things I 
learned however, include the following.&nbsp; He said that the MacBook was 
lighter, and it is, but I was told that the difference between the 13" MacBook 
and the 15" MacBook Pro is a mere 0.2 kg.&nbsp; As he said, the regular 
MacBook's battery lasts longer:&nbsp; 6 hours vs. 5 hours on the Pro.&nbsp; But 
a spare battery on the Pro is actually a little cheaper than on the regular 
MacBook.&nbsp; It's possible to edit "hi-vision" video on the MacBook Pro, 
unlike the MacBook, with "FinalBookPro" software.&nbsp; A colleague owns a copy 
of that, I heard.&nbsp; I don't know if I'll ever need to do that, but it sounds 
good.&nbsp; <BR><BR>I've been using a Vaio and, for such a little thing, the 
screen is very clear.&nbsp; I've been totally satisfied with that.&nbsp; But I 
constantly have to enlarge the type, and not having much space to work in makes 
for less efficiency.&nbsp; (Don't tell me there is software out there that 
instantly fixes that problem).&nbsp;&nbsp; The glare is pretty bad.&nbsp; There 
was less of a glare on my old Mac G3 (Wallstreet).&nbsp; The Vaio is 
ridiculously slow also since it comes with a lousy OS--not necessarily Sony's 
fault.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've run Ubuntu on it, and Ubuntu is a little better, but 
some things are slower than the old WallStreet, and a few functions didn't work, 
like the fan, a problem that someone has fixed, I read.&nbsp; The point is that 
I'd really like to to have a laptop with a nice screen that is fast, because I 
haven't used one for a long time.&nbsp; I heard that the regular MacBook and the 
MacBook Pro boot up quickly, and wake up quickly from sleep mode.&nbsp; But the 
Vaio I have takes 15 to 30 seconds to wake up from sleep mode, even when all the 
software has been recently re-installed, and everything is working.&nbsp; 
Booting up takes forever of course.&nbsp; I'm not the only one who has been 
surprised how slow my Vaio is.<BR><BR>What Micheal said about his experience 
with the MacBook Pro was also very convincing, and led me to think that I'd be 
happier with a Pro than with a regular MacBook.&nbsp; <BR><BR>By the way, I will 
probably need to use a <TT>WinXP VM on my new Mac too (and/or the Parallels 
software.&nbsp; Is that a VM?) because I am also often in the same&nbsp; 
situation in Japan he mentioned, where you can only do it in Windows, or you can 
just get the job done a lot faster by using a Windows machine than a Mac or 
Linux one.&nbsp; For example, the Japanese language environment in Windows has 
been fine-tuned so perfectly over the years, it's amazing.&nbsp; It works just 
the way you'd like it to, with a few notable exceptions.&nbsp; The Japanese 
language input on Ubuntu (can't remember the name of the software at the moment) 
has about 2 important advantages over the software that comes with Windows, 
which is impressive to be sure.&nbsp; (But I bet for a little investment in 
software, you can get those features in Windows too).&nbsp; I'm looking forward 
to seeing how much the Japanese language environment in Mac OSX has improved in 
the last few years.&nbsp; Many of the glitches (like Japanese file names getting 
messed up) are probably gone, I'm sure, but there are just so many more users in 
the Windows world...&nbsp; For those times, when I'm working with someone else 
or whatever, and need someone to do something on my computer in Japanese that I 
can't do myself, that's another advantage of having Windows available.&nbsp; I'm 
not going to be the only one using it.</TT></FONT>&nbsp; Japanese Windows users 
can often say right away, "Oh, just do blah blah blah," and problem is 
solved.<BR></FONT><TT><BR><FONT size=3>But back to the differences between Pro 
and regular, like others said, although the regular ones look like fine machines 
that can do all the basics, you get more upgrade-ability, more speed, more 
software choices, and probably, as a consequence, more years of use out of the 
Pros.&nbsp; So I'm betting that a Pro will be the best investment for 
me.<BR><BR>Sorry about my slow response again.&nbsp; This time it was because my 
old email address was discontinued.&nbsp; I knew it would be discontinued, but 
didn't know when.&nbsp; Please use the one for this message if/when sending me 
messages from now on.&nbsp; <BR><BR>Thanks 
everyone!<BR>Joe</FONT><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></TT></FONT></DIV>
