Hee!  No, I think if you take a step back and look at it
rationally, you're mad at Dan (for implementing EPLF -- see below)
not the other way around.

First things first: try "nlist" or "dir" rather than "ls" with
ncftp (I think, but I'm not sure, that new versions of ncftp
understand EPLF).  Note that you were able to retrieve the file by
giving an explicit path (ncftp just got confused becuase it
couldn't "see" it -- hence the strange message).

Believe it or not, he is fully compliant with the FTP RFCs (with
just two exceptions -- unrelated to your problem -- that are listed
in his attached document).  [I know you will now take me to task
for stating that djb tries to "just make it work" even when specs
aren't followed to the tee, but hear me out first.]

Dan is running his own anonftpd server on koobera, which uses his
own "EPLF" format for responses to the LIST command in the FTP
protocol.  Unfortunately, your ncftp doesn't know how to deal with
EPLF.

The obvious questions are: "Why did Dan write anonftpd instead of
using wuftp or whatever?" and "Why did Dan create EPLF instead of
doing what wuftpd or Sun/HP/IBM/SGI/DEC/whoever's ftpd do?".

The first question is easy: "security".  He wanted a secure,
read-only, anonymous ftp server.  He designed simple, chrooted,
100% read-only, non-authenticating server using no shared
libraries or administrative files.

EPLF is slightly more problematic, because although in theory he
followed the spec where it mattered, in practice he broke a lot of
ftp clients (ncftp being a case in point).

All EPLF is is a formalized, machine parseable specification for
LIST command responses.  Quoting RFC 959 re: the LIST command:

    "Since the information on a file may vary widely from system to
    system, this information may be hard to use automatically in a
    program, but may be quite useful to a human user."

*THAT* is what he tried to address.  EPLF is meaningful, easily
parsed, and useful (try writing an ftp client that works with
with *every* -- not most -- ftp server in existence).  Lot's of
servers respond differently to LIST requests -- Dan's responds
even more differently than most.

Now, as I said, in practice Dan's anonftpd actually breaks things
for many users.  (FWIW, Netscape, squid's ftp proxy, and others
all support EPLF these days.)  Still, that is the primary reason I
don't run anonftp.  If I ran a serious anonymous ftp server, I
would probably use Troll Tech's (similar to anonftp, but no EPLF).

He is most definitely not forcing anonftpd or EPLF down anyone's
throat, however.  It's commendable that he puts his own
documentation up for public consumption at all, and he can hardly
be faulted for using his own server and his own protocol for
serving these documents.  Although it may take significantly more
effort than obtaining most documents on the web (for some folks)
ANYBODY can obtain the files.

I've attached the EPLF specification to this message, in case you
can't obtain it at "<A TARGET="_top" HREF="http://pobox.com/~djb/proto/eplf.txt">http://pobox.com/~djb/proto/eplf.txt</A>".

Easily Parsed LIST Format (EPLF)
D. J. Bernstein, djb@example.com
19970413


1. Introduction

   The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) supports two commands that list
   files: NLST and LIST. The NLST response is easy to parse but provides
   very little information. The LIST response provides more information,
   but in a format that varies from system to system. The most common
   LIST formats are undocumented and impossible to parse reliably.

   This document defines Easily Parsed LIST Format (EPLF), a format
   for the LIST response that is usable by humans yet easy for programs
   to handle. This format is supported by anonftpd, a secure FTP server.

   One visible advantage of EPLF is that a browser can easily display
   dates in the viewer's time zone and native language. EPLF also makes
   it straightforward for an indexing program to automatically traverse
   an FTP area and for a mirroring program to avoid downloading the same
   file twice.

   EPLF also corrects a design flaw in FTP's handling of LIST arguments.
   An EPLF server must respond to ``LIST filename'' with information
   about that file and no others, even if that file is a directory. A
   client that wants an EPLF list of the contents of a directory must
   first CWD to that directory. A client that merely wants a list of
   file names in a different directory may use NLST.

   In this document, a string of 8-bit bytes may be written in two
   different forms: as a series of hexadecimal numbers between angle
   brackets, or as a sequence of ASCII characters between double quotes.
   For example, &lt;68 65 6c 6c 6f 20 77 6f 72 6c 64 21&gt; is a string of
   length 12; it is the same as the string "hello world!".


2. Format

   An EPLF response to LIST is a series of lines, each line specifying a
   different file. Each line begins with "+", continues with a series of
   facts about the file, and ends with &lt;09&gt; followed by the file name.
   Each fact is zero or more bytes of information, terminated by "," and
   not containing &lt;09&gt;.

   There are several possible facts, each of which appears at most once,
   in any order:

      "r"
         If this file name is supplied in a RETR command, the RETR
         should succeed. The server must supply this fact unless it is
         aware of file type problems, permission problems, or other
         reasons that RETR will fail. The presence of "r" does not
         guarantee success: for example, the file may be removed or
         renamed, or the RETR may suffer a temporary failure.

      "/"
         If this file name is supplied in a CWD command, the CWD should
         succeed. As with "r", the server must supply this fact unless
         it is aware of reasons that CWD will fail. The presence of "/"
         does not guarantee success.

      "i"[ident]
         This file has identifier [ident]. [ident] is a sequence of
         bytes not including "," or &lt;09&gt;. If two files on the same FTP
	 server (not necessarily in the same LIST response) have the
	 same [ident], those files have the same contents; a successful
         RETR of each file should produce the same results, and a
         successful CWD to each file should lead to the same working
         directory. (Under UNIX, for example, [dev].[ino] could be used
	 as [ident], where [dev] and [ino] are the device number and
	 inode number of the file.)

      "s"[size]
         The size of this file is [size]. [size] is a sequence of ASCII
         digits specifying a number. If the file is retrieved in TYPE I
         and is not modified, it will contain exactly [size] bytes. This
         fact should not be supplied if "r" is not supplied.

      "m"[time]
         This file was last modified at [time]. [time] is a sequence of
         ASCII digits specifying a number of seconds, real time, since
         the beginning of 1970 GMT. This fact cannot be used for files
         modified before 1970 GMT.

   Further facts may be defined in the future. Pieces of the fact-space
   beginning with "x" will be parcelled out to organizations that would
   like to define their own facts. Facts beginning with "X" are reserved
   for experimental use.

   All facts other than "/" and "r" are optional. Any statement of
   adherence to EPLF by a server FTP implementation must include a list
   of facts supported by that implementation other than "/" and "r".

   The server is under no obligation to ensure that LISTs in different
   directories produce disjoint lists of targets. For example, some
   servers may list a special ".." name that refers to the parent
   directory, or a "/" name that refers to the top directory. To avoid
   loops, a client attempting to traverse the FTP area must notice that
   the identifiers of these directories are the same as identifiers of
   directories already traversed.

   The server is also under no obligation to list all possible targets
   of RETR or CWD in a LIST command. Some servers may avoid listing
   special names such as ".." or "/". A client that wishes to return to
   a directory must use PWD and record the reply rather than relying on
   any useful meaning of CDUP, CWD .., or CWD /.

   Operating systems support a wide variety of means for obtaining the
   contents of a file from its name. For example, many systems support
   symbolic links: if ONE is a link to TWO, any reference to ONE is
   first replaced by a reference to TWO. Such information is irrelevant
   to FTP and is not displayed by any of the above facts. (Under UNIX
   this means that the server should use stat(), not lstat().)

   Servers are permitted to use arbitrary characters in file names,
   except for &lt;0a&gt; and &lt;0d&gt;. Beware that the characters &lt;00&gt;, &lt;09&gt;,
   &lt;20&gt;, and &lt;ff&gt; cause all sorts of trouble, ranging from inadequacies
   in the syntax of FTP commands to misinterpretation by some clients.


3. Examples

   Here is a typical EPLF response:

      "+i8388621.48594,m825718503,r,s280," &lt;09&gt; "djb.html" &lt;0d 0a&gt;
      "+i8388621.50690,m824255907,/," &lt;09&gt; "514" &lt;0d 0a&gt;
      "+i8388621.48598,m824253270,r,s612," &lt;09&gt; "514.html" &lt;0d 0a&gt;

   A typical EPLF-ignorant client will show the response to the user:

      ftp&gt; dir
      200 Okay.
      150 I'm looking through the directory. Trying to connect...
      +i8388621.48594,m825718503,r,s280,      djb.html
      +i8388621.50690,m824255907,/,   514
      +i8388621.48598,m824253270,r,s612,      514.html
      226 Finished transferring 127 bytes.
      ftp&gt; 

   A more sophisticated client (in the Pacific timezone) might instead
   display the following human-readable listing:

                         Tue Feb 13 15:58:27 1996   514/
             612 bytes   Tue Feb 13 15:14:30 1996   514.html
             280 bytes   Fri Mar  1 14:15:03 1996   djb.html


4. Sample code

   The following C function takes a pointer to a string containing one
   line of an EPLF response. It assumes that the original response did
   not contain &lt;00&gt;, and that the trailing &lt;0d 0a&gt; has been replaced by
   &lt;00&gt;. It returns a pointer to the filename, or 0 if the line does not
   appear to be an EPLF response.

      char *eplf_name(line) char *line;
      {
        if (*line != 43) return 0;
        while (*line) if (*line++ == 9) return line;
        return 0;
      }

   The following C function takes a pointer as above, and prints a
   human-readable listing as shown in section 3. It assumes that the
   local character set is ASCII, that file modification times fit into a
   local time_t, and that file sizes fit into a local unsigned long. It
   also assumes that time_t is interpreted as a number of seconds since
   the beginning of 1970 GMT. (A more portable function could use
   mktime() to discover the time_t representation of 1970 GMT.) Note
   that its output is not machine-readable, since the file name might
   contain the local newline sequence.

      #include &lt;time.h&gt;
      int eplf_readable(line) char *line;
      {
        int flagcwd = 0; time_t when = 0;
        int flagsize = 0; unsigned long size;
        if (*line++ != '+') return 0;
        while (*line)
          switch (*line) {
            case '\t':
              if (flagsize) printf("%10lu bytes   ",size);
              else printf("                   ");
              if (when) printf("%24.24s",ctime(&amp;when));
              else printf("                        ");
              printf("   %s%s\n",line + 1,flagcwd ? "/" : "");
              return 1;
            case 's':
              flagsize = 1; size = 0;
              while (*++line &amp;&amp; (*line != ','))
                size = size * 10 + (*line - '0');
              break;
            case 'm':
              while (*++line &amp;&amp; (*line != ','))
                when = when * 10 + (*line - '0');
              break;
            case '/':
              flagcwd = 1;
            default:
              while (*line) if (*line++ == ',') break;
          }
        return 0;
      }
