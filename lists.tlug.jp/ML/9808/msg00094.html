Hi Austin, good to hear you can come.

&gt; I'm so sorry to bother you guys with such a simple question, and I 
&gt; should have been reading my e-mail properly, but how do I get to where 
&gt; the meeting is being held?  This is the first time I'm going to go, and 
&gt; I'm not too good at following maps ;-).  Also yet another simple 
&gt; question, what time should I be there?

Here's a re-cap.  If you come to YAESU CENTRAL EXIT at 12:30, in
front of the ticket wicket exit, we'll meet you there.

-Joe.

                 Open TLUG August 8 Meeting
                 --------------------------

               All Open Source Groups Welcome
               ------------------------------



All Linux users and supporters of open source code and free software 
are invited to attend the August 8th Tokyo Linux Users Group meeting.  
Membership is open to anyone.  There are no membership dues or entrance
fees.

ABOUT TLUG:
----------

TLUG is a non-profit, non-political organization established in June 
of 1994 to exchange information on the use of Linux and Free Software 
Foundation tools.  TLUG has an active mailing list, home page, and 
regular physical meetings.  Discussions are primarily held in English,
but non-English speakers are encouraged to come and participate.
We especially want to encourage Japanese people to attend and will make 
efforts to support a bilingual meeting.  

TLUG hosts technical meetings every even month on the 2nd Saturday, and 
nomikai's every odd month on the 3rd Friday.

The TLUG home page is available at <A TARGET="_top" HREF="http://tlug.linux.or.jp">http://tlug.linux.or.jp</A>

        mac        68K; PowerMac
        pilot
        others?  bring your own project!

 o  Auction:  Your chance to bid on choice previously-owned computers and
        peripherals!   We have a lot of nifty machines, monitors, hubs,
        etc to auction off.  All proceeds go to TLUG.  

 o  Spam Contest:  Bring your *best* spam.  Bizarre, Bold, Bonkers ...
        your spam may win the prize!

        and also our own home-grown TLUG CD's.

        our growing library of books and CD's. All donations of media are

Most of the benefit of the meeting comes from informal discussions with 
other Linux users over lunch and during the demo's.  The goals of the 
meeting are to have fun and promote Open Source Code Software. 

We will be meeting at Tokyo station on Saturday August 8th in front of the 
Tokyo station Yaesu central ticket gate at 12:30.  There is more than one
Yaesu ticket gate, so be careful.  If you know you are going and don't
know what we look like, send us an email (tlug-admin@example.com)
and We'll make sure we wait for you.  After everyone gathers, we'll walk
down to the meeting place at HSBC.  

If you miss us at Yaesu Central, go directly to HSBC and sign in at the
back door as "TLUG".  Please go directly to the 10th floor.
