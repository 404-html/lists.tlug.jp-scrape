that *unlike cars* almost all of what is under the paint (including
the metal of the hood!) of one GNU/Linux is the same as all the
others. So when &quot;skinning&quot; the system the distro vendors have done
their users a disservice by making it ever harder for them to see how
that is being done, or even for a geek buddy who has memorized the
manpage for ifconfig(8) on 6 different systems to figure out how eth0
gets its IP address.
</pre></blockquote><tt><br>When I installed my first Gentoo system many years ago, I was forced 
to make decisions on things which I never realized were even open to 
any decision. Who would have thought that there were multiple ways to 
write the system log -- or multiple versions of cron? Not just 
&quot;versions&quot; in name only -- very different implementations with 
different config files.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>I picked syslog-ng and vixiecron. I'm satisfied with my choices but 
I'm not convinced any of the others would not have been just as 
satisfying. In fact, I'd be willing to bet someone out there is 
reading this and saying to themselves (if not to the list, 
eventually): &quot;No... &lt;whatever&gt;-cron is far more advanced than 
vixiecron&quot;. And, given the number of years that have passed since 
then, they're probably right. But I know these tools<br>
well by now, they work for me, I know the config format. Why change?</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>My point, I guess, is that there isn't quite as much in common under 
the hood as one might suspect. There is no &quot;standard&quot; for how ipconfig 
should work so when someone gets a new idea to make it work better, 
they write a new version. If everyone *else* thinks its better, the 
old one falls into obscurity. That leaves me free to pick whatever 
variation I like from the choices available at the time. And, 
presumably, someone does exactly that for each of the major distros. 
If all the UIs and config files were cast in stone, there would be no 
room for innovation.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>The downside is that it's no longer possible (if it ever was) to 
document a complete &quot;common&quot; Linux system because everything but the 
kernel can be swapped out whenever something better comes along (in 
all fairness, the kernel can be swapped out too -- ie: BSD, etc -- but 
doing so takes the system out of the realm of the current &quot;Linux&quot; 
discussion ;-). About the only things for which there are *not* 
multiple implementations (AFAIK) are the compiler toolchain and the 
basic shell utilities like &quot;cp&quot; and &quot;mv&quot;. And I suspect that the only 
reason those are common among all distros is because nobody has gotten 
annoyed enough at how they work to re-implement them to work any 
differently. But, if someone did, there goes that common Linux 
documentation out the window.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>(New users, by the way, don't generally *want* to know about &quot;cp&quot; and 
&quot;mv&quot;. Whether that's a good thing or not could certainly be debated.)
</tt></blockquote><tt><br>Having recently been a new user on another OS I can state what I was 
after.  I knew what I wanted to achieve and I wanted to know which tools 
to use to achieve it.  Did I have my preconceived ideas about what was 
the best way to do this? sure, did that stop me using other more 
effective tools? no.  I would expect that most new users who don't want 
to know about cp or mv have had bad experiences with DOS.  Should we 
pretend that cp and mv aren't the best tools in many situations, simply 
because some new users have had bad experiences with DOS?</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>There are multiple implementations of just about everything, including 
compilers, which is why learning about one distributions isn't 
particularly useful.  All distributions get EOL and chances are, if you 
are using a computer 10 years from now, you will be using applications 
with different configuration files.  Understanding something about your 
system and learning how to analyze and solve your own problems is going 
to save you far more time and make you a far more effective computer 
user then learning the solution to any particular problem.</tt><br>

hardware and software level.  If you look at Unix's they are all 
extremely similar.
</tt></blockquote><tt><br>Similar, sure. Alike, no -- not enough alike to not confuse beginners. 
Not when you consider the whole constellation of utilities that can 
easily be layered on top of the common kernel (which a beginner 
shouldn't have to deal with anyway). And if we're not talking 
beginners, then there's tons of books on various bits and pieces of 
the Linux infrastructure. Too much, in fact, to ever stuff into a 
single volume. So you have distro-specific hand-holding books to get 
you started and, once you start to grok the bits and pieces, you scan 
the O'Reilly catalog for in-depth material on the specific &quot;common&quot; 
pieces in which you're interested. I'm not sure how we could do any 
better.
</tt></blockquote><tt><br>Well it is easy to be confused when you don't know what you doing.  The 
obvious solution to this is to get an understanding about what you are 
doing, which doesn't take a library of books or a deep understanding of 
every facet of the UNIX universe.</tt><br>

unique implementation of some features, which is what you will get in 
a distribution specific book.  If you do this, every new Unix you 
learn will be a wonderful mystery ride, but who has the time for this?
</tt></blockquote><tt><br>When you've just unpacked your system and you're trying to get the 
printer to work, who has the time to read the entire sordid history of 
printing on Linux? For a beginner, it would be a disservice (IMHO) to 
give him much more than some screenshots, step-by-step instructions 
for the distro he has in front of him, and maybe an appendix called 
&quot;Once you're ready to swim in the adult pool, read these...&quot;.
</tt></blockquote><tt><br>I would suggest that following advice similar to this is the reasons so 
many new users have ongoing problems moving from windows to a Unix 
system.  It might be easier to tell someone what to do, but it just 
keeps them ignorant of what is actually happening and teaches them 
nothing about solving their own problems.</tt><br>
