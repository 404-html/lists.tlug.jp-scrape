<pre>Hi Ray - Re: &quot;If it isn't working out for you, and you're going with
an entirely new distribution, then try Ubuntu again but install in
Japanese from the beginning...&quot;
Actually, that's exactly what I did.  But although the whole sytem and
all applications have Japanese menus, I haven't been able to get
Japanese input working.

Re: &quot;I have English menus but Japanese input.&quot;
That's what I really want actually - but I've been going with
everything in Japanese both for an easy install and to force myself to
improve my Japanese reading skills.

CL: Re: &quot;That's odd.  The posted instructions worked for me and I was
going to add a 'thank you' when I had a moment free.  Inputting the
first two instructions in your post from the command line restored the
Ibus icon and, since my selections in ibus-settings were the way I
wanted them, I left those panels alone.  A reboot was all it took to
get me where I wanted to be.&quot;
I'm glad to hear that was of some use.  I suspect that in tinkering
around with it, I ended up installing too much stuff and ended up with
things that got in each other's way?  As a temporary fix, I tossed in
an older version, which is working, but do want to get going with the
newer releases.

Re: &quot;As for other OS choices:  A couple of Kubuntu users I know are
trying out Debian 4 + KDE and say that once you've eliminated the
increased asshole factor of the proponents and melted all of the 'ice'
by installing proper versions, you have an OS with a look and feel
similar to Kubuntu but without some of the oddities.&quot;
That sounds like it might be a plan.  I don't care for the direction
Ubuntu has taken with Unity.  It appears to be primarily designed for
small touch-screen devices (for which I wouldn't mind using it, but it
really sucks on a desktop computer).

NO: Re: &quot;In Ubuntu-jp mailing list, there is a thread that reports
recent IBus package can't work with Qt-based application. Does the
mail helps you?
<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-jp/2011-November/003924.html">https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-jp/2011-November/003924.html</a> &quot;
Possibly - I temporarly gave up on Kubuntu 11.10 with that machine,
but think I'll try this again on a test box and see if I can get
things to work.

DJI: Re: &quot;I realize this isn't for everyone, but I've been much
happier since I switched from packaged binary distros to Gentoo about
5 years ago. Gentoo draws the line between what I want to know as a
savvy user and what I don't want to have to know about what's going on
under the hood of my machine at a place that's just right for me
(personally).&quot;
Sounds like something I should try out on the test box and see if I
want to go in that direction.

RW: Re: &quot;Oh...forgot to add this to my previous e-mail:  I'm using
Ubuntu + Ibus + gnome.  I have never tried KDE before.  I know this
combination isn't working with KDE tools like kile, kdevelop, kate,
etc...&quot;
With one of the previous versions of Kubuntu I couldn't input Japanese
in Kate, but then it worked with 10.04.  When I had to have something
in Japanese in Kate, I'd type it elsewhere and copy-poste it in.  The
current problem seems to be no Japanese input anywhere.

RW: Re: &quot;In short, please try to modify your
/etc/X11/xinit/xinput.d/ibus file: - if [ -e
/usr/lib/qt4/plugins/inputmethods/libqtim-ibus.so ]; then + if [ -e
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt4/plugins/inputmethods/libqtim-ibus.so ];
then
&quot;Thank you for this!!  *That* was easy...yes, it worked.  Of course, I
also had to install the ibus-qt4 package, but this change fixed a
problem that I have been accepting for a month or two...  Now I can
comment my source code in Japanese.  ;-)  Thank you!&quot;
Well, I'm glad the thread helped someone else out, since I'm still
fumbling around here!

SS Re: &quot;I tried unity with Ubuntu 11.10 for about a month with unity
thinking maybe I could get used to it.  Finally I stumbled on a thread
for getting the gnome legacy stuff working from gnome 3.  Essentially
all you had to do was add the gnome 3 libraries and reboot, then
select the legacy stuff at login like before.
&quot;The ibus 日本語入力 worked fine with both Unity and Gnome.
&quot;Long term I don't know where ubuntu is going but this gnome setup
close enough to gnome 2 that I'm happy for now.  Hopefully ubuntu will
realize how many of us dislike unity and give us what we want.  I saw
that Ubuntu 12.04 is out but am reluctant to touch it.&quot;
Reluctant to touch it - yeah, that sums it up pretty well I think.
I'm only willing to try it out on a test box.  *If* it's less horrible
than 11.10, then I'll think about using it on a work machine.

SJT: Re: &quot;I was happier with Gentoo for a long time, but recently I've
become less happy.&quot;
Hmm...  On one hand there's &quot;Kaizen&quot; and on the other &quot;If it isn't
broken, don't fix it&quot;.  So much breakage done in the name of kaizen.

Anyway - thanks for all the feedback everyone!
Lyle
