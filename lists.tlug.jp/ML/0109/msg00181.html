I can understand your point; and I do agree to it.
However, I view it a bit differently from you.
I started out playing linux back when the symbol was elf/dwarf instead of
that cute little penguin. ^_^;
At that time linux wasn't that popular and online resource was little. So I
learn it by reading the HOWTOs and try&amp;error method.
Later on when linux got popular I was the kind of guy that will tell people
to &quot;RTFM&quot;; why? because I think all the answers are in the HOWTOs and if the
questions are big and nasty enough I should send an e-mail and ask the
authors instead.
Sometimes, if people caught me in a good mood I will help them out; elsewise
I will tell them go &quot;RTFM&quot;
And then one day I got stocked on some problems and didn't quiet understand
the README file that was suppose to explain to solution for it;  so I went
on irc and ask people for help. And someone reply back with &quot;RTFM&quot; to me; As
much as it hurt my pride I realize that what I did was wrong. And that
really made me changed myself.

There is nothing wrong with point out mistakes to people; however, one can
choose to do it in a professional and friendly manner or otherwise. That is
what I'm trying to get across to this mailing list. I agree with what you
are saying and I hold pretty much as the same value as you do. But I think
it will be better to say, &quot;Here, please go to linuxdoc.org and you can find
the howto for {etc, etc...}&quot; instead of just saying something like &quot;RTFM&quot;

That is just my 3cent value

&gt; &gt; When people see someone make a careless [dumb] comment, they can choice
to
&gt; &gt; make a friendly suggestion,  ignore it, make fun of it, or criticize it.
&gt;
&gt; You'll find there is a lot more tolerance here for dumb questions
&gt; (as opposed to inexperienced beginner questions, which are totally
&gt; OK) than there is for dumb answers.  The philosophy on a lot
&gt; of tech lists (not just this one) that values not saying something
&gt; that doesn't do anything to solve the problem, and especially
&gt; not saying something that's 100% unhelpful. The only thing worse
&gt; is giving somebody an actual wrong answer/bad information about
&gt; their problem.
&gt;
&gt; TLUG is perhaps more straightforward about saying that than
&gt; many lists are.  If I came up with something really stupid, I
&gt; would fully expect someone to say it was.  The atmosphere may
&gt; sometimes seem a bit harsh to newcomers, but most of this have been
&gt; on this list for a long time (almost four years for me, and others
&gt; have been around even longer), but it seems to work.  Maybe it's
&gt; a bit harsher than it once was, but we've had some really severe
&gt; signal:noise ratio problems in the past, and this has probably
&gt; led some of us who've been around here for a while to be rather
&gt; short-fused about things like that.  Plus, it's just the way we
&gt; are :-)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Of course there are people who will tell everyone to &quot;RTFM&quot; on
everything;
&gt; &gt; and there are people who are willing help out others.
&gt;
&gt; Believe me, telling someone &quot;RTFM&quot; is helping them out.  A lot.
&gt; Particularly because at the times RTFM is used, either that way or
&gt; in some politer form, it's usually because it's pretty obvious the
&gt; poster has not read the manual or they wouldn't be asking that
&gt; question in the first place.  People on TLUG and throughout the
&gt; wider Linux community place a lot of value on the idea of helping
&gt; yourself first.  That means you read the documentation, try to make
&gt; it work, if you have a problem or don't understand something, then
&gt; get on your favorite list, explain the goal, the problems you are
&gt; having achieving it, and what you have done so far to solve those
problems.
&gt; You'll find the repsonses are both larger in number and more helpful and
&gt; detailed.  The more information you give, the more people can help you.
&gt;
&gt; If a person is totally lost and doesn't even *know* what the proper
&gt; documentation or tool for what they want to do is (which happens to
&gt; lots of people when they are starting out, including me) they can
&gt; post a message and say &quot;I need to do X, but don't know how to do it/
&gt; what to use.  Can anybody tell me where to find some tools and/or
&gt; documentation to do this?&quot; if someone knows what you need and where to
&gt; find it, you can be pretty sure of getting an answer and possibly even
&gt; a quick rundown of what it does/how it works.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I believe most people on this mail list are the ones that wants to help
&gt;
&gt; Everyone on this list wants to help others, not just most people.
&gt; Sometimes telling someone not to say dumb things that are totally
&gt; useless to the recipient (heck, the guy already knew the dsl problem
&gt; was with Linux, he said so in his initial post) is helping them.
&gt; Simon is one of the most helpful and knowledgeable people on this
&gt; list, and has helped many people with many things on many occasions.
&gt; He has helped me on a number of occasions, and if he told me that my
&gt; answer was the stupidest thing he'd ever heard, I would go back and
&gt; take a good look at what I'd written, because the odds are pretty good
&gt; he would be right.
