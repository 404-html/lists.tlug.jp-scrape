Though I thought that I will not post anything further in this list 
after the *abuse* but, I feel that I can make some comments based on the 
discussion between roylo and jack. So .... I am a littile bit of 
technical person (may be not as technical as other *technical* members 
of TLUG)  and my area of specialisation is Linux device driver, network 
programming and embedded linux (mips porting). I am from CS background 
(from India) and associated with linux for last seven years and 
contibuting to a number of open source developments. As I am a veteran 
from ILUG and kernel-mailing list, ... I felt that this LUG will also be 
a same kind of friendly place to interact with the linuxers. I got 
myself subscribed to TLUG to know the linux trends in Japan and also &quot;to 
get help&quot; and &quot;to help&quot;. I used to witness &amp; contribute to really tech 
discussion in kernel maling list but there, the abuse is not at all 
present. Also, in ILUG, we discuss from &quot;newbie question&quot; to &quot;ioctl 
specification problem&quot;. In both of them (I feel both of them are *little 
bit technical* and quite active ... ~300mails/day), the attitude is 
quite different. There, we say &quot;ur posting/patch is stupid&quot; but before 
saying that, we rectify that patch/solution so that it can help the 
original poster. Despite this, we never loose the spirit and friendship. 
In the contrast, in TLUG, ppl are so *technical*, they criticise &quot;loose 
posting&quot; but they are incapable of handling the original problem of the 
mailing thread. So that's why I thought that &quot;I am in wrong place in 
worng time&quot;. Now I am thinking that I am really in wrong place because I 
am *&quot;in between ultra cool technical ppl&quot;*


archan

ps. I do respect the nice ppl of TLUG

&gt;&gt;When people see someone make a careless [dumb] comment, they can choice to
&gt;&gt;make a friendly suggestion,  ignore it, make fun of it, or criticize it.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;You'll find there is a lot more tolerance here for dumb questions
&gt;(as opposed to inexperienced beginner questions, which are totally
&gt;OK) than there is for dumb answers.  The philosophy on a lot
&gt;of tech lists (not just this one) that values not saying something
&gt;that doesn't do anything to solve the problem, and especially
&gt;not saying something that's 100% unhelpful. The only thing worse
&gt;is giving somebody an actual wrong answer/bad information about
&gt;their problem.
&gt;
&gt;TLUG is perhaps more straightforward about saying that than
&gt;many lists are.  If I came up with something really stupid, I
&gt;would fully expect someone to say it was.  The atmosphere may
&gt;sometimes seem a bit harsh to newcomers, but most of this have been
&gt;on this list for a long time (almost four years for me, and others
&gt;have been around even longer), but it seems to work.  Maybe it's
&gt;a bit harsher than it once was, but we've had some really severe
&gt;signal:noise ratio problems in the past, and this has probably
&gt;led some of us who've been around here for a while to be rather
&gt;short-fused about things like that.  Plus, it's just the way we
&gt;are :-)
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Of course there are people who will tell everyone to &quot;RTFM&quot; on everything;
&gt;&gt;and there are people who are willing help out others.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Believe me, telling someone &quot;RTFM&quot; is helping them out.  A lot. 
&gt;Particularly because at the times RTFM is used, either that way or
&gt;in some politer form, it's usually because it's pretty obvious the
&gt;poster has not read the manual or they wouldn't be asking that 
&gt;question in the first place.  People on TLUG and throughout the
&gt;wider Linux community place a lot of value on the idea of helping
&gt;yourself first.  That means you read the documentation, try to make
&gt;it work, if you have a problem or don't understand something, then
&gt;get on your favorite list, explain the goal, the problems you are
&gt;having achieving it, and what you have done so far to solve those problems.
&gt;You'll find the repsonses are both larger in number and more helpful and
&gt;detailed.  The more information you give, the more people can help you.
&gt;
&gt;If a person is totally lost and doesn't even *know* what the proper
&gt;documentation or tool for what they want to do is (which happens to
&gt;lots of people when they are starting out, including me) they can
&gt;post a message and say &quot;I need to do X, but don't know how to do it/
&gt;what to use.  Can anybody tell me where to find some tools and/or
&gt;documentation to do this?&quot; if someone knows what you need and where to
&gt;find it, you can be pretty sure of getting an answer and possibly even
&gt;a quick rundown of what it does/how it works.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I believe most people on this mail list are the ones that wants to help
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Everyone on this list wants to help others, not just most people.
&gt;Sometimes telling someone not to say dumb things that are totally
&gt;useless to the recipient (heck, the guy already knew the dsl problem
&gt;was with Linux, he said so in his initial post) is helping them.
&gt;Simon is one of the most helpful and knowledgeable people on this
&gt;list, and has helped many people with many things on many occasions.
&gt;He has helped me on a number of occasions, and if he told me that my
&gt;answer was the stupidest thing he'd ever heard, I would go back and
&gt;take a good look at what I'd written, because the odds are pretty good
&gt;he would be right.
