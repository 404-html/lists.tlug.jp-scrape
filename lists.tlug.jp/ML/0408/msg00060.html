&gt;&gt;     Josh&gt; Will one of the i18n gurus on this list (Steve, Jim, et al.) 
&gt;&gt;     Josh&gt; please recommend *the* i18n primer for software developers? 
&gt;&gt;     Josh&gt; I need to remedy my glaring lack of knowledge in the area.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; There isn't one that I know of.  Jim and I were going to write one,
&gt;&gt; but it hasn't happened yet.

Naruhodo. I am bearing a huge load of guilt because I have done very
little towards it.

&gt;&gt;     Josh&gt; Using Google, I found "Introduction to i18n", by Kubota
&gt;&gt;     Josh&gt; Tomohiro,[1] which I have printed off for reading. Is this a
&gt;&gt;     Josh&gt; good intro?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; No.  It's written by a Japanese, which normally implies a quite warped
&gt;&gt; point of view toward i18n.  Kubota is no exception.  Nor am I (I may
&gt;&gt; not have been born Japanese, but my I18N baptism was in the Church of
&gt;&gt; Shit-JIS Mojibake).

I've read some of Kubota's stuff. It's not but, but a bit idiosyncratic
(but then, aren't we all?)

&gt;&gt; However, it may be the best there is in English.  Suzuki et al have a
&gt;&gt; book in Japanese, but it's oriented to the specialist.  O'Reilly's X
&gt;&gt; Window System series had an X11R5 update volume which introduced a
&gt;&gt; bunch of things reasonably well, but obviously it's heavily
&gt;&gt; X-oriented.  And I don't know how that's been treated in the X11R6
&gt;&gt; editions.  My article in the LJ in 1999 was too heavy on theory, not
&gt;&gt; very strong on practice, as was my chapter in Wrox's Professional
&gt;&gt; Linux Programming.

'Twas early days though. I things are a bit clearer now in a practical
sense.

&gt;&gt;     Josh&gt; I am trying to avoid writing software that is difficult to
&gt;&gt;     Josh&gt; internationalise, so I am looking to become familiar with
&gt;&gt;     Josh&gt; the basics of i18n.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; There are no basics of I18N, really.  It's all advanced details.

And that's the hurdle we are trying to climb over. There is a heap of
stuff  you have to do and do right.

&gt;&gt; However, if you plan to leave the details to others, it's not too
&gt;&gt; hard.  The first principle is to convert to Unicode (if you're working
&gt;&gt; in a low-level language like C/C++, preferably widechars, not UTF-8,
&gt;&gt; so as to ensure that English doesn't work serendipitously if you use
&gt;&gt; the wrong API) as soon as possible, and do all internal string
&gt;&gt; processing in Unicode.

Um. I'm not so sure about this. I can think of many situations where
you can comfortably leave the internals in UTF8. The hit converting
UTF8-&gt;Unicode-&gt;UTF8 while working on a large file can be horrible. For
example, the main part of the internal format of my JMdict is in EUC,
and I can open it in a EUC-capable editor in 3 seconds. Opening the 
UTF8 version in something like Yudit takes about as long as making a cup
of coffee.

&gt;&gt; The second issue is to decide whether you are supporting localization
&gt;&gt; (ie, users are normally monolingual), or multilingualization (the user
&gt;&gt; community is multilingual, even if the users are not).  In the former
&gt;&gt; case, you just need to make sure you always do the conversion, and the
&gt;&gt; default external encoding can be a global setting.  In the latter
&gt;&gt; case, you need to strictly control which modules are allowed to do
&gt;&gt; I/O, because otherwise it's possible for different modules to get
&gt;&gt; conflicting ideas about what encodings are being used.  Furthermore,
&gt;&gt; if somebody later decides to do more sophisticated conversions etc,
&gt;&gt; they'll be chasing bugs forever as different parts of the program get
&gt;&gt; updated at different times because there's no complete list.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; The third issue is message localization using gettext.  This has a
&gt;&gt; moderate number of tricky parts if you want to do it right (for
&gt;&gt; example, dealing with printf when the variable parts come in different
&gt;&gt; orders in different languages), but it's also something that you can
&gt;&gt; typically leave to a specialist, since these issues are normally
&gt;&gt; localized to each message.  That is, your program's architecture can't
&gt;&gt; make it harder or easier for the translation team.  However, if you
&gt;&gt; want to encourage L10N from the get-go, learn that stuff and provide
&gt;&gt; message catalogs.  There are lots of tools, and the suite in the
&gt;&gt; gettext package is quite complete.

All well put.

&gt;&gt; As long as you use a language (a p-language, for example) or toolkit
&gt;&gt; (GTK) that supports Unicode internally, you generally do not have to
&gt;&gt; worry about issues like font handling or input methods.  Those are
&gt;&gt; somebody else's problem.  ;-)

Many people think these are the problem, but I agree that if you have
done the earlier bits properly, fonts and inputs are a done deal.

Jim
