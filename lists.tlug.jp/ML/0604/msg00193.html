Some names from Wikipedia:

<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitor_plague">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitor_plague</a>

</pre><tt>&quot;Faulty capacitors have been discovered in motherboards as old as Socket 
</tt><tt>7 and have affected boards manufactured up to the present day. While 
</tt><tt>this article deals primarily with desktop computer hardware, this 
</tt><tt>problem is by no means limited to that area. These capacitors can also 
</tt><tt>be found in some cameras, network switches, audio equipment, DVD 
</tt><tt>players, and a range of other devices. Even some car electronic control 
</tt><tt>units have been found to have these same brands of often-failing 
</tt><tt>capacitors. However, computer components are by far the most common 
</tt><tt>location of these capacitors.&quot;
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>In cameras! In cars! In DVD players! This really should be on TV with 
</tt><tt>reporters crawling all over....
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">


</pre><tt>&quot;Indeed, a strong case can be made that these capacitors (which often 
</tt><tt>fail in 6 months or less) are still being manufactured, and are still 
</tt><tt>being chosen over superior components by manufacturers to use in their 
</tt><tt>products.&quot;
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Still being used in new equipment?! No! Stop the line! Get better parts 
</tt><tt>into those boards!
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">


</pre><tt>&quot;As of May 2005, [2] some evidence shows that the failing Nichicon 
</tt><tt>capacitors on the iMac, Intel, and Dell boards are due to a different 
</tt><tt>problem (capacitors overfilled with electrolyte) than the one discussed 
</tt><tt>on this page (faulty electrolyte formula). However, both the effects on 
</tt><tt>the system and the physical appearance of the capacitors are the same as 
</tt><tt>the other failing capacitors, as is how to identify them, and the 
</tt><tt>required repair.&quot;
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>&quot;The primary cause of these problems is industrial espionage gone wrong, 
</tt><tt>with some Taiwanese electrolyte manufacturers using a stolen formula 
</tt><tt>that was incomplete, and lacked ingredients needed to produce a stable 
</tt><tt>capacitor.&quot;
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>&quot;Sadly, once the problems with these capacitors became known, there is 
</tt><tt>evidence that motherboard manufacturers continued to use the bad 
</tt><tt>capacitors either knowingly or unknowingly. Only ABIT has admitted to 
</tt><tt>the problems, while other manufacturers have given responses ranging 
</tt><tt>from ignorance to denial. Some have gone so far as to issue legal 
</tt><tt>threats to web sites mentioning their names in conjunction with 
</tt><tt>capacitor failures. IEEE's Spectrum has an overview of the situation, 
</tt><tt>aptly titled &quot;Leaking Capacitors Muck up Motherboards&quot;, after the 
</tt><tt>tendency of the capacitors to leak their fluid onto the motherboard.&quot;
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>&quot;Soldering on motherboards, which are typically made of six or more 
</tt><tt>layers, some of which may have ground planes, and may use lead-free 
</tt><tt>solder requiring higher temperatures than leaded solders, can be 
</tt><tt>challenging. Attempting a repair without the right equipment and skills 
</tt><tt>can easily destroy an otherwise repairable board.&quot;
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">


Some names:

Bad

</pre><tt>* Canicon (found on PNY video cards (at least the GeForce4 based 
</tt><tt>models), among other components))
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">
* Chhsi
* Choyo
* CTC
</pre><tt>* Fuhjyyu (found in Antec and FSP (and so many others licensed from FSP, 
</tt><tt>for example Zalman), Tagan and so many other power supplies to this day)
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">
* Gloria
* GSC
* (G) Luxon (also G-Luxon) (Found in some older ECS motherboards)
* Hermei
* I.Q.
* Jamicon
* JDEC
* JPCON
* Jun Fu (found in some Deer power supplies)
* OST (found on some PCCHIPS, ECS, ASUS, and EPoX motherboards to this day)
* Raycon
* Lelon
* Licon
</pre><tt>* Taicon (found on ASRock motherboards and BFG video cards, part owned 
</tt><tt>by Nichicon or so their website claims)
</tt><tt>* Jen Pan TUR/TUL (known as &quot;PCE-TUR&quot; or &quot;PCE-TUL&quot;, owned by CEC) (found 
</tt><tt>in Enermax power supplies and in Seasonic power supplies (300W, prod. 
</tt><tt>2002)). Mostly good, but they had a series of the TUR wich was also bad.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">
* FUH YIN (found on the memory board of a hp workstation x4000)


Suspicious brands

</pre><tt>* Tayeh &#x2014; This brand appears to not actually exist, indicating the 
</tt><tt>actual manufacturers were wary of putting their name on their product; 
</tt><tt>and probably a fake of &quot;Ta-Keh&quot;, a genuine maker of high-end capacitors 
</tt><tt>for audio equipment, used by Denon and Technics (Panasonic).
</tt><tt>* Rulycon &#x2014; A clone of &quot;Rubycon&quot;, a well-known manufacturer of 
</tt><tt>high-quality capacitors, right down to the style of the cases and the 
</tt><tt>fonts used for lettering.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">


Admitted

</pre><tt>* Jackcon &#x2014; The only capacitor manufacturer to own up to their mistake; 
</tt><tt>they are also the only one to issue free replacement capacitors to 
</tt><tt>people who had theirs fail. Their new products appear to be of greater 
</tt><tt>quality but still not as good as known-good brands.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">


Possibly reformed

</pre><tt>* Teapo &#x2014; Teapo has denied these claims, but evidence suggests their new 
</tt><tt>capacitors are sound. However their older ones appear to suffer from the 
</tt><tt>same problems other brands do.
</tt><tt>* NRSY &#x2014; with X-shaped vents are suspect (counterfeits); the new NRSY 
</tt><tt>capacitors with K vents are genuinely high-quality.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">


Good

* Rubycon
* Nichicon
* Panasonic
* Sanyo
* Nippon Chemi-con
* United Chemi-Con
