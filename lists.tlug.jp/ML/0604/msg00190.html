<tt>As I've been told in a computer user group, it's a well-known issue that 
</tt><tt>many computers built from around the year 1999 are now having their 
</tt><tt>capacitors ballooning, blowing up and/or leaking.  I've always used the 
</tt><tt>word &quot;shocking&quot; as a sarcastic joke, but this time I really am... 
</tt><tt>shocked... to discover that the sudden death of one of my computers (a 
</tt><tt>Dell Dimension-C - a model that was only sold in Japan) was due to such 
</tt><tt>a mundane problem!  I had thought that capacitors lasted far longer than 
</tt><tt>just a few years.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>When I did an autopsy on the Dimension-C, I found nearly all the 
</tt><tt>capacitors (other than the really tiny ones) with ballooned tops and a 
</tt><tt>couple of them had leaked goo across the circuit board!  And then 
</tt><tt>yesterday, I was given a custom-built computer that is working fine, but 
</tt><tt>when I took a close look at the main circuit board, I discovered that 
</tt><tt>all of its large capacitors (something like 14 of them) have ballooned 
</tt><tt>tops.  So how long does that computer have to live?  There are very few 
</tt><tt>specific model names listed, but so far we have Dell Dimension-C, 
</tt><tt>Optiplex-GX270, and Optiplex-GX280.  I also had an Optiplex-GX-150 
</tt><tt>suddenly die on me, but the visible capacitors seem to be okay 
</tt><tt>(something in the power supply then?).
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Anyway, let's look into this via the net a bit, with links and some 
</tt><tt>quotes from a few different sites:
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">


<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.badcaps.net/">http://www.badcaps.net/</a>
</pre><tt>&quot;...... the bad capacitor problem has been plaguing computer 
</tt><tt>motherboards since about 1999 to the present day.  It now being 2006, I 
</tt><tt>am STILL seeing later model P4 and Athlon boards with this problem.
</tt><tt>    Over the years, there have been massive quantities of name-brand, 
</tt><tt>high quality motherboards failing prematurely due to these faulty 
</tt><tt>electrolytic capacitors used in their manufacturing process.  This has 
</tt><tt>doomed many popular and expensive brands of motherboards, including: 
</tt><tt>Abit, Asus, MSI, Gigabyte, Supermicro, DFI, Dell, Hewlett Packard, IBM, 
</tt><tt>and many more!&quot;
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Those first six names - Abit, Asus, MSI, Gigabyte, Supermicro, DFI - are 
</tt><tt>they all manufacturers of component mother boards made for custom 
</tt><tt>computers?  That might explain the reluctance of some people in user 
</tt><tt>groups to name specific companies they're having trouble with.  In the 
</tt><tt>case of the custom box I was given, I haven't yet discovered who made 
</tt><tt>the mother board.  Probably it's written somewhere not visible until 
</tt><tt>removed from the box.

</pre><tt>    &quot;Last week, Dell announced it was going to take a $300 million 
</tt><tt>financial charge on its earnings to cover costs associated with the 
</tt><tt>replacement of motherboards with faulty capacitors in some of its 
</tt><tt>Optiplex workstations. The Dell system boards in question were 
</tt><tt>manufactured from April 2003 to March 2004, according to several 
</tt><tt>contract computer repair firms that are starting to replace the systems.
</tt><tt>    PCs from Hewlett-Packard and Apple Computer and other PCs using 
</tt><tt>Intel motherboards have all faced similar issues, according to the 
</tt><tt>companies, contractors and several online bulletin boards.&quot;
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Dell, HP, Apple &quot;and other PCs using Intel motherboards&quot;, and Athlon 
</tt><tt>(got one sitting beside me as I write this).  The manufacturers are 
</tt><tt>doing a good job of hiding information on this.  It's not a &quot;mystery of 
</tt><tt>the universe&quot; type of thing.  The capacitors came from somewhere and 
</tt><tt>there is some scientific cause for their early demise!  But from reading 
</tt><tt>the stuff on the Internet, you'd think we were talking about distant 
</tt><tt>galaxies or something that could only be surmised with a loose theory 
</tt><tt>and not pinned down to good science and investigative journalism... 
</tt><tt>&quot;some&quot;, &quot;many&quot;, &quot;and others&quot;....
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">


</pre><tt>    &quot;At issue are faulty capacitors on motherboards that store power 
</tt><tt>and regulate voltage. Defective capacitors found in the Dell Optiplex 
</tt><tt>workstations, some Apple iMac G5s, HP xw-series workstations made in 
</tt><tt>2004 and PCs with the Intel D865GBF motherboard have been found to 
</tt><tt>bulge, pop, leak and crust over, causing video failure and periodic 
</tt><tt>system shutdowns.
</tt><tt>    Photos showing Dell's Optiplex GX270 and Optiplex GX280 with 
</tt><tt>defective capacitors have been widely reported on Web sites such as 
</tt><tt>Badcaps.net, PowerEdgeForums.com. Pictures of other faulty capacitors 
</tt><tt>have been spotted on Apple's own discussion boards, MacOSG.com, and 
</tt><tt>G5Support.com.
</tt><tt>    Only HP would identify the maker of its faulty capacitors: 
</tt><tt>Nichicon, of Kyoto, Japan.
</tt><tt>    Nichicon, which has been in the business of making capacitors for 
</tt><tt>50 years, has a strong track record, and the majority of Nichicon's 
</tt><tt>products have no problems at all, HP representatives and enthusiast 
</tt><tt>sites said.&quot;
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>And of course Nichicon is not supplying any information about WHY this 
</tt><tt>is happening.  I - for one - would like to know.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">


</pre><tt>    &quot;The bad capacitors are found in some motherboards, video cards and 
</tt><tt>power supplies for PCs, monitors, video tape players and televisions.&quot;
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>I had thought only in motherboards!  In monitors and power supplies as 
</tt><tt>well?  This is becoming a bigger issue all the time it seems.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">


</pre><tt>    &quot;Experts say that if capacitors are not made right, they start to 
</tt><tt>deteriorate after three or four years, rather than lasting the expected 
</tt><tt>seven years.&quot;
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Seven years?!?  I look over beside my computer and see my 1981 Sony TV - 
</tt><tt>full of capacitors - that has never been serviced and is still working 
</tt><tt>fine after 25 years on the job.  Seven years?  Okay, how about some 
</tt><tt>detail here!  Maybe it's something along the lines of: &quot;High performance 
</tt><tt>capacitors with ultra thin insulating layers and in constant use are 
</tt><tt>only expected to last around seven years and large batches of 
</tt><tt>substandard capacitors are failing after only two or three years of 
</tt><tt>use.&quot;  So, were the &quot;experts&quot; quoted in the article in fact experts, or 
</tt><tt>just lawyers and/or PR types engaged in damage control with the media?  
</tt><tt>I suspect the later!
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">


</pre><tt>    &quot;'Faulty capacitors were attached to Intel D865GBF motherboards, 
</tt><tt>which are sold to computer manufacturers and in some electronic retail 
</tt><tt>stores.'  Intel has acknowledged previous problems within the capacitor 
</tt><tt>manufacturing industry and has an advisory posted on its site talking 
</tt><tt>about electrolytic capacitor leaks on some 875-based and 865-based 
</tt><tt>desktop motherboard products.&quot;
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Okay, &quot;previous problems within the capacitor manufacturing industry&quot; - 
</tt><tt>but what problems exactly and with precisely which manufacturers?  Why 
</tt><tt>no details?
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">


</pre><tt>   &quot;In August, Apple issued a limited recall of some of its 
</tt><tt>first-generation iMac G5 models sold between approximately September 
</tt><tt>2004 and June 2005 featuring 17- and 20-inch displays with 1.6GHz and 
</tt><tt>1.8GHz G5 processors. The official cause was blamed on an unnamed 
</tt><tt>'specific component failure.'&quot;
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Fear of product liability lawsuits seems to rule the day.  A friend of 
</tt><tt>mine had his iMac die on him....

</pre><tt>    &quot;Blackburn said Dell receives its capacitors from a variety of 
</tt><tt>vendors and declined to specify which supplier was responsible.&quot;
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Why?  Why does the manufacturer get anonymity  The parts didn't come 
</tt><tt>from the outer galaxy, they came from a factory right here on earth.  
</tt><tt>Why not own up to the problem and shed more light on what's going on?  
</tt><tt>Damage to the company's reputation?  Oh, right - mustn't harm the 
</tt><tt>companies responsible, never mind the users, they can just buy new 
</tt><tt>computers.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">


</pre><tt>    &quot;A picture posted by a Dell Forum member shows two black- and 
</tt><tt>gold-colored bulging capacitors with &quot;1500 hF 6.3 v&quot; printed on the sides.&quot;
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Sloppy!  The capacitors are black, with gold lettering saying &quot;1500 uF 
</tt><tt>6.3V +105C&quot; on one side, and large polarity markings on the other.  (I 
</tt><tt>know, because I have the dead motherboard from my dead Dell Dimension-C 
</tt><tt>sitting right by me now - I just had a good look.)
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">


</pre><tt>    &quot;As for a possible industry-wide problem caused by the faulty 
</tt><tt>capacitors, calls to various PC manufacturers were not immediately 
</tt><tt>returned.&quot;
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>What people don't know can hurt them but not the manufacturer, so 
</tt><tt>they're hiding everything.  About the only information that seems to 
</tt><tt>have come out is via user groups.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">


</pre><tt>    &quot;A person familiar with the problem said Dell's capacitor issue is 
</tt><tt>unlikely to be related to any specific Intel processor used in Optiplex 
</tt><tt>systems, but did note that similar bulging issues from some Taiwanese 
</tt><tt>suppliers have been observed.&quot;
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Better than nothing... does anyone else out there have additional 
</tt><tt>information?  It's not going to come from the manufacturers responsible, 
</tt><tt>so it has to come from us.
