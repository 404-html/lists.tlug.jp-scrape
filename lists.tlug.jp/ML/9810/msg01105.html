 &gt; &gt; Also if you split mail list please do not automatically subscribe

 &gt; &gt; let know the header spec beforehand, so I can modify procmailrc
 &gt; &gt; accordingly
 &gt; 
 &gt; We'll make sure you are not included on any new lists automatically.

I am sorry I was not asking for my personal favor.
it was my polite way of saying that:

It is abuse of power to change faq without stating what 'trouble' is
or use mail addresses of mail list for other purpose without
consulting addressee first. 

Isn't that obvious?
You have response like:

 Stephen&gt;     Jim&gt;     o random emotional complaints about Linux used to vent a
 Stephen&gt;     Jim&gt; person's frustration.
 Stephen&gt; 
 Stephen&gt; Or any operating system or software system.  If there's a specific
 Stephen&gt; complaint about OS/X with a Linux solution, that's exactly what we're
 Stephen&gt; here for.  General "hey, look, MS f**ked up again, check this URL" is
 Stephen&gt; OK by me.  "Venting" is what's inappropriate.  (The way it's written
 Stephen&gt; it looks like it's aimed straight at John de Hoog, which is surely not
 Stephen&gt; the intent.)

 John&gt; --Random emotional complaints about Linux, or any operating system or
 John&gt; software system, used to vent a person's frustration.
 John&gt; 
 John&gt; This seems to be saying that people are not supposed to vent their
 John&gt; frustration about problems with Linux. Yet Linux, and other computer
 John&gt; platforms as well, can be intensely frustrating. What's wrong with emotion?
 John&gt; Isn't the real intention here to stifle complaints about Linux?

Even it says in faq "praise in public, criticize private", it looks to 
me the open public attack on the private citizen.

 &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; So far the rule that enforces is 25kbyte limit for posting, which
 &gt; &gt; according to my proposal is routed to the news server.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Our present maximum is set to 40K.
 &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; 2) But, replying to the original post doesn't go to the mail list. it
 &gt; &gt; goes to news server accomodated to the topic. Only header infomation
 &gt; &gt; goes to the mail list, but body of message only suggest where the
 &gt; &gt; message is in the accomodating news server.
 &gt; 
 &gt; We don't have a news feed, only the mailing list.  
 &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; 3) specified topic like other popular OS has a gateway to other mail
 &gt; &gt; list or news list to send to and monitor response and retrieve the  
 &gt; &gt; messages to accomodating news server.
 &gt; 
 &gt; This is a linux list - Let's keep any links to linux-related topics.

And TJH says in his Civility statement:

 Civility&gt; 1.  Attack the idea--fine.  not the person.
 Civility&gt; 2.  Recognize that in theory, at least, you could--at some time--be wrong
 Civility&gt; 3.  Don`t judge people entirely/mostly by their e-mail behavior

I was also stating the idea how to solve the balance between public
interest and freedom of expression as I see the problem here.
And public interest is supposedly that professional unix programmers
who consist of more than half of tlug members do not want to hear
other poeple moping about non technical non programatic issues not
regarding Linux.

And my idea is that self rating rule and spontaneous diversity using
news server. it uses main list as main channel and migrate into other
channel using news server only feed back header info into main list. 
I don't know feasibility right now.

I feel that the main list is not crowded enough nor project oriented
enough to impose split.
So let the market principle decide what it likes.
In this thinking I thought there should be gateway to other
interesting topic including other OS.

Poeple who don't use Linux so far can subscribe to tlug mail list and
still can address their own interest not necessarily concerning
Linux. But if Linux poeple know their interest thru main list, maybe
they can address the interest Linux way and allure them into using
Linux. Or vice versa. 

Let's say Tokyo has population of 12,000,000.
Let's say in there there is household of 4,000,000.
Let's say 20% of household that has a computer is 800,000.
Let's say 1% of computer that runs Linux in household is 8,000.
Let's say 20% of Linux user in household who can use English is 1,600.

Don't you think it is important to reach out 1,600 people?

If you insist on that tlug is a group of professional unix programmer
mainly meaning more than half of the members are programmers. it
cannot grow. Obviously all of 1,600 are not proffesional unix
programmer, but could be other professionals that can help tlug.

I think PHT also need to reach out more than 1,600 people to
sell. Your way of thinking could be direct conflict with PHT.

So please attack me on the idea. not factual correctiveness.

Regards,
Kei.
