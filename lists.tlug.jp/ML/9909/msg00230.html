The special night session at the Linux World Expo will happen
at the same date and time (9/29, 18:00), so it will be a hard
decision... in which one will you participate? 

*****************************
SPECIAL EVENT
*****************************
We are proud to announce that Tim O'Reilly, president and founder of
O'Reilly &amp; Associates, will make a special appearance and give an
informal talk at The Celt in Roppongi the evening of Wednesday
September 29.  Tim is in Tokyo to give the Keynote Speech for
LinuxWorld Expo. This is an open event and free of charge.

	Date: 9/29 (Wed)
	Time: 18:00 
	Place: The Celt (Roppongi, Tokyo)

Presented by the ICA (International Computer Association) 
in harmony with the Tokyo Linux Users Group (TLUG) and the
Tokyo PC Club.

*****************************
OUR SPEAKER
*****************************
Tim O'Reilly is founder and president of O'Reilly &amp; Associates,
thought by many to be the best computer book publisher in the world.
In addition to publishing pioneering books like Ed Krol's The Whole
Internet User's Guide and Catalog (selected by the New York Public
Library as one of the most significant books of the twentieth
century), O'Reilly has also been a pioneer in the popularization of
the Internet. Its Global Network Navigator site (GNN, which was sold
to America Online in September 1995) was the first true commercial
site on the World Wide Web, and  inspired the development of the
Mosaic browser, Netscape, and many of the developments that followed.
O'Reilly's Songline Studios affiliate continues to pioneer new content
developments on the web.

O'Reilly has also become a leading publisher of
independently-developed software for the web. Its WebSite server was
the first web server for Windows NT and Windows 95, and has won
numerous software development awards.

Tim himself has written numerous books on computer topics, most
notably "UNIX Text Processing", "Managing UUCP and USENET", "The X
Window System Users' Guide" and "The X Toolkit Intrinsics Programming
Manual". As an O'Reilly &amp; Associates editor he has also had a hand in
the development of many of the company's other titles, including "UNIX
in a Nutshell,""Programming Perl," "Sendmail," and "Essential System
Administration."

Tim graduated from Harvard College in 1975 with a B.A. cum laude in
Classics. His honors thesis explored the tension between mysticism
and logic in Plato's dialogues. Here's a really little known fact:
Tim's first book is "Frank Herbert: The maker of Dune." Out of print.
If you have a copy you'd like to sell, contact Steve Carter
<A TARGET="_top" HREF="mailto:scarter@example.com">mailto:scarter@example.com</A> and make a deal.

&gt;From the years before the Internet became the force it is now, O'Reilly
books were the indispensable guides to actually making Unix and
networking actually work. Today it's almost impossible to do high
level, or even good entry level computer work without at least one
O'Reilly book close at hand. Most of us have several, and are waiting
for more. But there's more to O'Reilly &amp; Associates than the computer
books, wonderful as they are. There's the philosophy and vision behind
the company and the books AND the software. They are staying privately
held, sticking to their principles, and still making money. All the
people I've met who work there actually love their jobs, and the
company. What a concept! How do you do it, Tim?  Come Wednesday and
find out.
