<h3>
Name</h3>
This group shall be called the <i>Linux Internationalization Initiative</i>,
and may be abbreviated as Li18nux or LI18NUX
<h3>
Description</h3>
This is a voluntary working group, consisting of Linux-related contributors
who are working on Globalization, which is composed of Internationalization
and Localization.
<p><b><font size=+1>Group Status</font></b>
<p>The LI18NUX working group is currently not incorporated.
<p><b><font size=+1>Focus and Goals</font></b>
<p>This group shall focus on the Internationalization of a core set of
APIs and components of Linux distributions in order to achieve a common
Linux environment where an internationalized Linux application can be executed
and behave correctly regardless of distributions. The results of the working
group shall be open to everyone, and be proposed to Linux Standard Base
for its LSB 2.0 or later.
<p>The scope of our activities will be focused on software/application
portability and interoperability in the International context.
<p><b><font size=+1>Objectives</font></b>
<p>The objectives of the working group are as follows:
<ul>
<li>
Leverage collaborative efforts among contributors of Linux Internationalization.</li>

<li>
Provide a forum for contributors to have technical discussions about Internationalization.</li>

<li>
Perform necessary coordination among projects that are related to Linux
Internationalization.</li>

<li>
Actively disseminate Linux Internationalization related information.</li>

<li>
Provide specification of Internationalized APIs and components that every
distribution should include to ensure application portability and interoperability
among various Linux distributions.</li>

<li>
Develop a catalogue of Internationalized components of Linux (including
documentation, message catalogues, etc).</li>

<li>
Establish necessary liaisons with various committees and organizations
who are working on Internationalization</li>

<li>
Define a process for creation of and dissemination of a core set of Globalized
documentation and localizable elements for Linux and applications that
run on Linux</li>

<li>
Produce documentation on how to globalize applications and other resources
for Linux.</li>

<li>
Promote the universal translation of existing and future documentation
by working with existing documentation and localization providers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Background</h3>
Linux is an operating system that is used widely all over the world. However,
most Linux distributions are originally developed for English speaking
people and have not yet been internationalized well. Therefore, local Linux
distributors and user groups are providing many patches to the English
Linux distributions to support local language and local cultural conventions.
We call this kind of patch approach <i>direct localization</i>.
<p>The direct localization and patch approach has the following negative
effects:
<ul>
<li>
Less application portability and interoperability among different distributions</li>

<li>
An internationalized or localized application for one distribution may
not execute correctly on another Linux distribution that is localized to
a specific language environment.</li>

<li>
A patch may conflict with other patches, thus an application of one patch
does not necessarily preserve&nbsp; another localization/internationalization
patch .</li>

<li>
Inconsistent localization approaches may be adopted by each distribution</li>

<li>
High development,testing and maintenance costs for both Linux distributions
and Linux applications</li>

<li>
No multi-lingual capability</li>
</ul>
In order to let worldwide Linux users enjoy Linux and Linux applications
in their preferred language environment, and to allow writing&nbsp; real
globalized applications, such as Internet based applications, Internationalization
of Linux is an urgent requirement for all&nbsp; Linux users, Linux distributors,
and Linux application developers.
<h3>
Subworking groups</h3>
Subworking groups will be established as necessary to work on tasks associated
with realizing our objectives.
<h3>
Membership requirements</h3>
The membership of this working group shall be open to anyone who is interested
in contributing to Linux Internationalization. A registration form will
be available on our Web page, and the form filled in shall be submitted
to Li18nux.
<h3>
Co-chair and administration officers</h3>
The group shall have the following co-chair and administration officers
by geography.

</ul>
The co-chairs are responsible for all administrative matters regarding
the operation of this group (e.g.,
<br>communication among this group, meeting arrangements, and official
announcements from this group).
<h3>
Steering committee</h3>
The steering committee of this working group consists of co-chairs of this
working group, leaders of subworking groups, a representative from interested
distributions (commercial and non-commercial), and a representative from
the Linux Standard Base. The following is the mission of the steering committee:
<ul>
<li>
Decision making for this working group</li>

<li>
Work plan development</li>

<li>
Coordination among sub working groups</li>

<li>
External relationships</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Meetings</h3>
This working group shall have face-to-face meetings on a bi-monthly (that's
every two months) basis. The regular meetings will mainly be held in the
San Francisco Bay area, but this group would like to have at least one
meeting outside of the United States annually. This group encourages adhoc
meetings or BOFs (Birds-of-a-Feather) at Linux or Internationalization
related events.
<h3>
Online discussion and information Web sites</h3>
This working group shall use the linux-i18n@example.com (or linux-i18n@example.com,
when available) mailing list for communication among the members. This
working group may have other mailing lists that are specific to sub tasks
as required. The administrative request to the linux-i18n mailing list
should be sent to linux-i18n-request@example.com
<p>This working group shall have an Web site, www.li18nux.org for information
sharing. The Web pages in the site shall include, at a minimum, an official
information section, sub group section, and free discussion and information
section. The contents in the official information section is the subject
to be approved by the steering committee, and content of each sub group
section is subject to be approved by either sub group or its leader.
<h3>
Relationship with standards organizations</h3>
This working group will establish necessary liaisons with groups who are
working on Globalization or Linux standardization.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The candidate liaisons are to be with:
<ul>
<li>
Linux Standard Base - www.linuxbase.org</li>

<li>
Linux User Groups in various countries who is working on localization of
Linux</li>

<li>
