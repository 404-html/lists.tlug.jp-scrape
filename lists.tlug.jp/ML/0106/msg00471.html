Hello.  My name is Scott Hughes.  I work for Red Hat, and I am the
"non-tech with a write-once, read-only brain", to whom SL Baur, is
referring. In all fairness to myself, however, I will say that I am in
actuality, not as SL Baur describes.

Having said that, I would like to briefly respond, just once, to the
series of postings that started regarding "Re: IS MICROSOFT SECRETLY
USING OPEN SOURCE?", that somehow called for such a comment by SL Baur
(who I have never met nor spoken with).

I agree. This is the fundamental issue.

&gt; In other words, MS is lying again, and while this
&gt; isn't very surprising it is funny to see them caught in the lie. A bit
of a
&gt; side note, but I have never heard RH claim that they never use any MS
&gt; product.

Precisely. Thank you Matt.

Thanks for the follow up Jack.  Although I think that what you wrote here
applies in many cases, it so happens that it doesn't apply to mine.

I can use Linux, and I do use it, all the time. I do also have Windows
installed on one of my machines  (amongst the many Linux machines and
servers I have) and it just so happens, by an absolute fluke, that the
email I sent to be forwarded to this list was from a Windows machine.

I use a windows machine at times like when someone sends me their network
map in Visio format (an extreme but clear example), and since Visio (for
Windows) is the only software that I know of that opens Vision documents,
I use my Windows machine to boot it up.

To clarify my stance, let me say that I personally believe that the open
source movement is a great thing, and I really enjoy Linux. It is my
preferred platform for nearly all my work, and the one on which I intend
to continue expanding my career.

&gt; Based on personal experience, I'd say probably not.  He's some non-tech
&gt; with a write-once, read-only brain.  There are plenty of them in any
&gt; company, Linux distributor or not.

I am not one of them.

Regards,

Scott.

&gt;
&gt; I disagree with this statement, but plenty of other people do not.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; In the long term... Yes it's justifiable.
&gt;
&gt; Unfortunately, you are correct.  It wasn't this way in the past.  When
&gt; I was at TRW we had no trouble training secretaries to use Unix, vi
&gt; and TeX, etc.  The ones I talked to liked it after they were trained[1].
&gt;
&gt; I find it galling that lusers would prefer mail software from Microsoft
&gt; that severely inconveniences recipients, but that is the current state
&gt; of the art.
&gt;
&gt; Footnotes:
&gt; [1]  And it didn't take very much to train them, either.
