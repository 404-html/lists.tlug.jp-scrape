Maybe you do; maybe I don't.  Gotta support your family, you know.
(Note the original sender :-)  Check this out!  (Note that a bunch of
Japanese ISPs have already signed up.)

The comment about upgrading via a software download is particularly
intriguing; this doesn't require new hardware??!

If you can really get 56 kbps connections over regular phone lines, X
will work pretty well.  But many people seem to have trouble at
28.8kbps.  However, the "software" comment and other aspects make it
sound like it's a compression technology or something that would work
at various underlying rates.  In any case, it looks like the
technology will fly commercially.

  U.S. ROBOTICS ADDS MORE THAN 60 ISPs, BRINGING TO 100 THE NUMBER 
  SUPPORTING x2 TECHNOLOGY FOR 56 KBPS INTERNET AND REMOTE ACCESS
  
  
  ISPs Represent More Than 16 Million Subscribers Who Will Have Access 
  to Faster Downloads Over Standard Phone Lines
  
  
  SKOKIE, Ill., -- January 6, 1997 -- U.S. Robotics (NASDAQ:USRX) today 
  announced that it has added more than 60 Internet service providers, 
  bringing to 100 the number now supporting U.S. Robotics' x2[tm] 
  technology, which provides Internet and on-line connections over regular 
  phone lines at up to 56 Kbps -- nearly twice as fast as those currently 
  available.
  
  The 100 ISPs supporting x2 include regional and national ISPs, plus the 
  world's largest global ISPs and online services. U.S. Robotics has just 
  launched its ISP Xtreme Advantage Program, which provides co-marketing 
  opportunities for ISPs, and will continue expanding the list of ISPs 
  supporting x2 as the program gets underway.  The list of ISPs committed 
  to supporting x2 to date represents a total of more than 16 million 
  consumer and business subscribers.  
  
  "The support we're receiving for x2 technology is overwhelming, and we're 
  pleased that regional and global ISPs and on-line service providers have 
  lined up behind this breakthrough technology," said Ross Manire, senior 
  vice president and general manager of U.S. Robotics' Network Systems 
  Division. "People from all parts of the world will be using x2 technology 
  to download graphics-intensive files and other data at nearly double the 
  current maximum analog modem speed."
  
  U.S. Robotics expects to be first to market with a 56 Kbps product, and 
  anticipates that it will deliver the only complete, end-to-end solution 
  for 56 Kbps with products for both ends of the connection available in 
  the first quarter of 1997.
   
  "Because U.S. Robotics controls its DSP technology, our ISP customers can 
  upgrade their remote access servers in their points of presence via a 
  software upgrade, enabling them to easily add x2 support," Manire said. 
  "And, they can easily upgrade to other new technologies by adding new 
  software, protecting their technology investment and giving them the 
  flexibility to easily add new capabilities."

  announced their support for U.S. Robotics' x2 technology:
