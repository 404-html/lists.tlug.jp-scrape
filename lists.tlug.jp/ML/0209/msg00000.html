A couple of co-conspirators and I are working on a series of
Quick-N-Dirty Guides to various *nix topics, good for
when you just need to know how to do &quot;XYZ&quot; right now and
will worry about stuff like the man page later.

Since few TLUGgers seem to use any crypto software - signed messages
on TLUG are rare, and because I'd like input, presented for your
approval (or to constructively rip to bits :-) is the Quick-N-Dirty
Guide to GPG.

Please tell me about anything you find wrong with it (or right with
it), bearing in mind that this is a minimalist document whose
sole aim is to tell you what you need to do Right Now to
get GPG going, even if you've never heard of it before.  It aims
to give you the &quot;what&quot; and let you go find out the &quot;why&quot; for yourself
later in the documentation. 

With no further ado, then, the second draft of the QND Guide
to GPG.

Thanks,

Jonathan
GPG key: DF12B4EF (5399 C834 3ABB C3AF 610C  5345 D5D6 E6EA DF12 B4EF)

================================

		Quick-n-Dirty GPG

Welcome to the QND Guide to GPG.

QND guides contain a lot of &quot;what&quot; information and 
very little &quot;why&quot; information.  Reading the GPG Documentation
at <A  HREF="http://www.gnupg.org/docs.html">http://www.gnupg.org/docs.html</A> is highly recommended.

This document contains seven sections, which cover making
sure you have GPG and that it is installed correctly,
making a key pair, making a revocation certificate, 
dealing with keyservers, and advertising your key.

This QND guide is at present oriented toward RPM-based
distributions, but in future, instructions for other 
distros will be included, or possibly it will be branched
into Distro-specific versions.

This is a draft copy.  Comments and suggestions are
welcome.

BEFORE YOU START
----------------

Read this guide all the way to the end before you do anything.
After you have read this entire guide and understand what to
do, proceed to Step 1.


1) DO YOU HAVE GPG?
-------------------

In a shell, type:

which gpg

This should return the path to gpg, probably
/usr/bin/gpg.

If it finds it, go to Step 2.  If it doesn't, 
continue with this step.

If you're here, that means you didn't find gpg when you typed
which gpg.  In that case, you will need to download a GPG
package from your distribution's FTP site or a mirror.

After downloading it, su to root in a shell, change
to the directory where you downloaded the RPM, and
type:

rpm -Uvh name-of-gpg-rpm-here

which gpg

should now give you the location of gpg, probably
/usr/bin/gpg.


2) MAKE GPG SUID ROOT
---------------------

Skip this step if you do not have root access to the
computer you are using.

SU to root, then type:

chmod +s /path/to/gpg/from/step1/gpg

Example: chmod +s /usr/bin/gpg

This is to make GPG use secure memory.

Exit root and go back to your normal userid. 


3) GENERATE A KEY PAIR
----------------------

Type:

gpg --gen-key

NOTE: If you have not generated a key pair before, you
will see messages like these:

----------
gpg (GnuPG) 1.0.6; Copyright (C) 2001 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
under certain conditions. See the file COPYING for details.

gpg: /home/newbie/.gnupg: directory created
gpg: /home/newbie/.gnupg/options: new options file created
gpg: you have to start GnuPG again, so it can read the new options file
----------

This is normal.  Now, we will repeat the previous step once more.
Type:

gpg --gen-key

-Accept the default for the key type (just hit enter).
-Enter 2048 for the suggested key size.
-It will ask if you really need it.  Yes.
-It will ask for how long the key should be valid.
 Enter 0 (default).
-It will ask if that is correct.  Yes.

- Userid section.  Enter your first and last name.
- Enter your email address.
- Optional comment.  Leave blank.
- Confirm the userid you entered.  Enter O(kay) here if
  it's acceptable.

Your userid is your name + email address + optional comment, like
this:

Ima Newbie (This is my comment) &lt;imanewbie@example.com&gt;

IMPORTANT:  Next is the passphrase section.  Let's
start with a subsection called...


&lt;DANGER&gt;
=========================
Your passphrase is very important. It should be long
(a sentence, not just a word), and contain mixed-case
letters along with numbers and punctuation.  Obscuring words
by plugging in numbers that look like them is good. For example
3 for E/e, 4 for A/a, 0 for O/o, 1 for L/l, 7 for T/t,
etc, is advisable.  This is in the style used by 31337 
H4x0rs.  If you understand those two words, you get
the idea.

DO NOT store your passphrase on your computer.  EVER.  Keep
it offline in a secure place.  Taped to your monitor, or
anywhere else in the vicinity of your computer, does not
constitute a safe place.  If you can memorize it, that is
best.

Treat your passphrase as being more valuable than the root
password. It is.
=========================
&lt;/DANGER&gt;


Now, the key pair will be generated.  You will be 
asked to perform some other action such as typing or moving
the mouse while this is being done, to generate good random data.
Do it right away, generating the key pair takes only a few
seconds.

4) GENERATE A KEY REVOCATION CERTIFICATE
----------------------------------------

You will need this in case your private key is ever
compromised or you lose your passphrase.  Do it now,
because if you wait until that happens, it's too late.
You won't be able to do it then.

Type:

gpg --gen-revoke &quot;YOUR-USERID-HERE&quot;

Your userid is your name + email address + optional comment, like
this:

Ima Newbie (This is my comment) &lt;imanewbie@example.com&gt;

EXAMPLE: gpg --gen-revoke &quot;Ima Newbie &lt;imanewbie@example.com&gt;&quot;

The revocation certificate generator will ask you
these questions.  Answers immediately follow them.

- Create a recovation certificate? y
- Select reason: 2
- Optional description: (leave blank)
- Is this OK? y
- Enter passphrase: YOUR-PASSPHRASE-HERE

You will see the revocation certificate on your screen.

It will look like this:

-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: GnuPG v1.0.6 (GNU/Linux)
Comment: For info see <A  HREF="http://www.gnupg.org">http://www.gnupg.org</A>
Comment: A revocation certificate should follow

&lt;Some encrypted text here&gt;

-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

Cut and paste this somewhere and print it and/or store it on a 
CD or floppy (CD is better, floppies aren't reliable).
Both printing it and storing it on a CD or floppy is best.
DO NOT store the revocation certificate on your computer,
ever, for the same reasons you should never store your
passphrase on your computer.  Keep this revocation certificate
secure, also for the same reasons you should keep your
passphrase secure.


5) SEND YOUR PUBLIC KEY TO A KEY SERVER
---------------------------------------

cd ~/.gnupg

Type:

gpg --list-keys

You will see something like this:

pub  1024D/DF12B4EF 2002-07-27 Jonathan Q &lt;jq@example.com&gt;

But it will have your public key info here.  The part you want
is after pub 1024D/ - in my case, it's DF12B4EF. That's my key ID.

Connect to the Internet, then type this command, putting your
key ID in the obvious place:

gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --send-keys YOUR-KEY-ID

Repeat the same command with a different keyserver:

gpg --keyserver www.keyserver.net --send-keys YOUR-KEY-ID

6) GET MY PUBLIC KEY
---------------------
gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys DF12B4EF

You are now ready to both send and receive GPG-encrypted
or signed files.  How to do those things will be covered
in another document.

7) TELLING OTHERS ABOUT YOUR KEY
--------------------------------

The easiest way to advertise your key to others is to put it in your
.signature file so it is included in your email.  My .signature
contains this:

GPG key: DF12B4EF (5399 C834 3ABB C3AF 610C  5345 D5D6 E6EA DF12 B4EF)
gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys  DF12B4EF

Two lines, with my key, my key fingerprint, and the command
to get my key from a keyserver.
