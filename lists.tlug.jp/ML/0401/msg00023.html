Akemashite Omedetou!

I'm one of the long-term lurkers - I've been subscribed
to the list since moving to Japan in January of 1997.
I was never able to go to the meetings because they were
always on Friday nights and my martial arts training has
priority. I did get together with the Tsukuba 'branch'
one time at a beer garden at Tsukuba center back when I
was doing consulting work out there.

One reason that I haven't contributed to the list much
was because I feel my *nix ability is quite low compared
to most of the regulars, so I've contented myself with browsing
and picking through interesting topics as they have arisen
- selfish, yes, I know... :), but I was initially one of those
people who didn't RTFM that much, largely because TFM was
a bit obtuse for my newbie brain. A lot of reading over the
last 7 years has changed that somewhat, but I'm still
learning...

My company could possibly provide space for a meeting, albeit very
small meeting space - our office space will only seat about
10 people. If anyone wants a 'puchi' meeting, let me know. :)
As far as hiring sysadmins go... not right now, but perhaps
in the future... In the meantime, we're very hungry for Java
and C++ programmers!! (resumes gladly accepted)

Here's to a great new year for TLUG!
'kotoyoro'...

&gt; &gt;&gt;Hmm...  It seems I joined this group too late.  Everybody's gone now...
&gt; 
&gt; It tends to seem that way.  There was a time when 60 or more people would
&gt; come to a tech meeting and a nomikai would see 30.  TLUG went through
&gt; some difficult politcal times and many of the long-time core members
&gt; evetually through up their hands in disgust and left because of an influx
&gt; of the new breed of newbie- the kind that say &quot;I don't want to read the
&gt; documentation or figure it out for myself.  I tried Linux, so you *owe*
&gt; it to me to hold my hand, wipe my butt, and anything else I may require
&gt; as I run Linux - and while those particular troublemakers and their
&gt; shortsighted supporters who opposed muzzling them were dealt with and they
&gt; lost the battle for control of TLUG, the damage was done.  Those who
&gt; left have never returned, and they were our best and brightest.
&gt; 
&gt; They could return now in safety, but I don't think any of them ever will.
&gt; If they are lurking, none of them has told me about it.
&gt; 
&gt; If TLUG could find a corporate sponsor to provide meeting space and all,
&gt; it's possible that something like those glory days could return, if
&gt; there were TLUGgers willing to put in the large amount of time that
&gt; such a thing requires.  Such a sponsor would be difficult to find now,
&gt; I think, and it would be even more difficult to find a lot of people
&gt; who both could and would put in all those hours of setup for a meeting,
&gt; and such. 
&gt; 
&gt; It was pretty great stuff, though, and I'm glad I was there to see it.
&gt; The &quot;cross-platform Linux meeting&quot; was especially cool.  I think there
&gt; were at least half a dozen architectures represented, including an
&gt; Amiga (although I think that may have been running NetBSD, not Linux).
&gt; Not many people still in TLUG were there back then.  There was me, Jim T.,
&gt; Ayako, Albeto I think (Alberto, are you still out there?).  Anybody else
&gt; I'm forgetting?  That was in 1998, IIRC, so we've had a really huge
&gt; membership turnover since then.
&gt; 
&gt; Dang, all this really makes me wish I was back in Japan.  Anybody need
&gt; a sysadmin? ;-)
