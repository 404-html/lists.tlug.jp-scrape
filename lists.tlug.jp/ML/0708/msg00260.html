&gt; &gt; I still maintain that the *perception* of something being free and its
&gt; &gt; *actually* being free are two different issues.
&gt;
&gt; I'm not going to start on that argument, as it will quickly head off
&gt; into philosophy, metaphysics, relativity, and religion :-)

Ha-ha!  Yeah!  One acquaintance of mine who was convinced that his
computer was irreparably damaged when W-2K died on him, was so pleased
to get his computer back from me working (with Suse 9.1 Linux) that he
wrote back saying &quot;This is great!  It's like a religion or something!&quot;

&gt; &gt; I think it's tragic
&gt; &gt; that people think Windows is like a piece of hardware inseparable from
&gt; &gt; the machine as it rolls off the assembly line.
&gt;
&gt; I agree with you.  I have spent the last week trying, and failing, to
&gt; get a new laptop without Windows.

Just yesterday, I stumbled upon a laptop from Epson Direct with Linux
for about Y60,000, see:
<a  href="http://shop.epson.jp/pc/lx1000">http://shop.epson.jp/pc/lx1000</a>  I tried to post that information to
the list, but it doesn't seem to have made it through for some reason
(or did I miss it?  Did you see it?).

&gt; &gt; And one last comment about &quot;free&quot;.  I think there is nothing free
&gt; &gt; about Microsoft's products.  Microsoft is *not* free in cost; *not*
&gt; &gt; free to use as one likes; *not* free to transfer to others, etc. etc.
&gt; &gt; Saying it's &quot;free&quot; is an outrage.
&gt;
&gt; &quot;Free&quot; is a strongly emotive word, especially on lists like this.  Is
&gt; it still an outrage if we say that Windows has an insignificant cost
&gt; to the buyer when included with a new PC?

No problem there!  I wasn't arguing what general users think, I was
upset that thinking individuals were saying it is free as though that
were an irrefutable fact.  That I found extremely offensive!

&gt;  That is what I am trying to
&gt; say.   You may strongly dislike the fact that Windows is included by
&gt; default with most PCs, but what is wrong with the low-cost statement?

No problem.  And I fully realize that the pre-installed version is
cheaper than the boxed version, but it isn't free (even if the user
thinks it is)!

&gt; The main problem I have with bundled Windows is not the cost, because
&gt; it is insignificant.  I don't want my PC purchase to increase the
&gt; Windows usage statistics, since I'm not going to use it.  I wasn't
&gt; able to buy a bare PC this week, but I was able to choose between
&gt; Vista and XP, so I choose XP so I won't help the Vista statistics.

Yeah - that sounds good.  I would have done the same thing, except
since there's that Epson laptop option for about Y60,000, I think I'd
go for that.

&gt; &gt; Anyway, thanks for being civil, I really do appreciate that!  I hope
&gt; &gt; you don't take offense at my strong feelings regarding the non-freedom
&gt; &gt; of Microsoft.
&gt;
&gt; I am not offended.  I share some of your opinions and feelings about
&gt; this, and I know that Windows is not actually free, in any sense.  I
&gt; just think that the inaccurate perception of the general public is
&gt; more significant than you do.

There has been a huge misunderstanding then!  I have never thought
that the general public knows what is going on with computers or
thinks about what, if any, cost is involved for the software.  I was -
however - outraged that people who know better were saying that it's
free as though that were the case in an absolute sense.  If they had
said &quot;it is perceived as being free by average users&quot; I wouldn't have
had any complaint at all.  So maybe the entire problem was no more
than sloppy use of terminology?  I think there's a huge difference
between saying &quot;it is free&quot; and &quot;it is perceived as being free by many
users&quot;.  The first statement being an outrageous lie, and the second a
statement of probably truth.

Anyway!  I'll post something if I decide to get that Epson laptop.

Lyle
