<pre>Hi, I'm replying to three people in this mail.

&gt;&gt; I. review of tex/latex structure, where everything goes in the TDS.
&gt;Can you make it in *ONE* slide for less than 30 seconds?
&gt;I think basic definitions and explanations are just enough.

Yes. I agree it is not something I would want to dwell on, were it not
for the issue that everything else depends on knowing this. Making it
short as possible is a good goal, although I'd want to hand out more
information then, as there are going to be people with less experience
than you there.

&gt;&gt; II. multilingual and CJK with LaTeX
&gt;Can you make it in *ONE* slide for less than 30 seconds?

Yes. Again, for people who don't know this, it would be necessary to
hand out more slides. And besides, I think the video would become
useless. I iterate that if enough people already know this, I will not
bother with the talk, it would be a waste of time.

&gt;The author of pdftex - Han The Thanh is/was working on a C wrapper.
&gt;I don't know the latest dev. status but it is cool!

AFAIK, pdftex is good, but it cannot be used for everything. Just as
some packages cannot work with the latex/dvips route for whatever
reasons.

&gt;&gt;     d) [maybe] discussion of OTF with LaTeX
&gt;&gt;
&gt;Is it superior to TTF? I don't know much about OTF but I think it is old
&gt;in comparison to TTF.

In short, it is newer and superior.

&gt;&gt;  4. enhancing the business card with new fonts (latex/dvips and
pdftex routes)
&gt;Can you make a template?

I have one, yes. I am not going to make another one though. My idea is
to give a talk about how people can accomplish something, and what
they should set out to master if they want to achieve that, not about
what I personally have accomplished.

&gt;&gt;  5. making a presentation or poster with Japanese fonts
&gt;Can you make templates and compare the output with MS Word, OpenOffice?

Again, yes, I have templates. It is doubtful whether I can compare
output with that of MS Word, OpenOffice is possible, if I have the
time.

After all that, I'm not sure what it is you'd like to see from such a
talk (or whether you consider it even worthwhile).

&gt;I've been doing with it. If you're doing Japanese typesetting with TeX,
&gt;XeTeX is very much worth checking out.
XeTeX is very nice, but it is not fully compatible with all packages
in LaTeX AFAIK.
I have been meaning to try it out in comparison too, for the talk. It
is included in TeXLive also, for those that wish to try already.

&gt;Just install TeXlive and put

&gt;\usepackage{CJK}

&gt;in the preamble and
&gt;
&gt;\begin{CJK*}[dnp]{JIS}{min} ... \end{CJK*}
&gt;
&gt;around the Japanese.  If you want to do Chinese and/or Korean too,
&gt;things get more complicated, mostly because there are enough free
&gt;fonts for those languages to make understanding the NFSS
&gt;worthwhile. :-)
Yes, that is the essence. When one wants to use UTF8 there is a slight
modification, and if one wants to use non-free fonts the big work
begins. As yoo point out, there are many more available fonts for
non-Japanese CJK, so there is much more help for people using those
too.
