&gt;&gt;&gt;Your usage of the word &quot;free&quot; is valid according to some definitions.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Curt's usage of &quot;free&quot; is entirely consistent with modern economic
&gt;&gt;&gt;terminology.  And it is the appropriate usage for this context.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;LHS: Then &quot;modern economic terminology&quot; is sophistic and divorced from
&gt;&gt;reality.  When you pay money for something that you don't want, it's
&gt;&gt;not free.
&gt;
&gt;Maybe you should read your dictionary again, or maybe we all should
&gt;stop using the work &quot;free&quot; if we are all using different meanings.

That definition of free refers to freedom, the definition of free Curt
was referring to was one of money.  You're mixing those up as a joke,
or are you a non-native English speaker?

Anyway, here are the definitions of free, as per your request:

slavery: a land of free people.

30.	not subject to rules, set forms, etc.: The young students had an
hour of free play between classes.
31.	easily worked, as stone, land, etc.
32.	Math. (of a vector) having specified magnitude and direction but
no specified initial point. Cf. bound1 (def. 9).
33.	Also, large. Naut. (of a wind) nearly on the quarter, so that a
sailing vessel may sail free.
34.	not containing a specified substance (often used in combination):
a sugar-free soft drink.

46.	to exempt or deliver (usually fol. by from).
47.	to relieve or rid (usually fol. by of): to free oneself of responsibility.
48.	to disengage; clear (usually fol. by from or of).
49.	free up,
	a. to release, as from restrictions: Congress voted to free up funds
for the new highway system.
	b. to disentangle: It took an hour to free up the traffic jam.

&gt;But anyway, back to the point.  If I buy a PC with Windows, the
&gt;Windows component will not cost me extra: that is what normal
&gt;unsophisticated people call &quot;free&quot;.

Show me where it says in the dictionary that free means &quot;paying for
something but not realizing you paid for it&quot;, that's more along the
lines of ignorance, not free or freedom!
