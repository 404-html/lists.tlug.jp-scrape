<pre style="margin: 0em;">Hello,</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">In conclusion, we do not have to split our ML.</pre><br>
<tt>Gernot Hassenpflug ????????:
</tt><blockquote style="border-left: #5555EE solid 0.2em; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0.85em"><pre style="margin: 0em;">Hello all,</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">I enjoy TLUG's ML a lot, and I have mixed feelings about the last
couple of days of posts. I appreciate that the list is populated by a
bunch of very smart people who hold strong views on what they believe
in.
</pre></blockquote><tt>It is hard to find a FOSS related mailing list like tlug. IMO, for a ML 
like this to survive,<br>
slashdotted people are needed, and it is required that they are smart. 
Unfortunately,<br>
such people are very strong opinion in any view.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>People like Steve or Curt make make traffic. They make our brain working.<br>
I keep my mount shut most of the time but I read their emails, delete 
emails that<br>
are not of my interest. It stresses us if we try to 
read/understand/reply *all* emails in this ML :D
</tt><blockquote style="border-left: #5555EE solid 0.2em; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0.85em"><tt> It is also clear that it is impossible for everyone to agree, nor<br>
do I think that is desirable. Self-discipline and strong beliefs are<br>
hard to balance, and the job of the list master is a thankless one.<br>
I'm happy to see that none of the near flame-wars  (and I admit I have<br>
sympathies on both sides here, and also had to hold back from replying<br>
in a non-linux-related manner to some things on another thread in the<br>
admin list) degradated into incivility, 
</tt></blockquote><tt>That is a nature of human-being. I don't want to join a flame-war though 
I think it is a thing one( me )<br>
should do. If it was Vietnamese, I would :D.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>The root of problems most of the time are outside Linux. As you are 
reading, most of thread are not<br>
directly related to Linux, but it is related to FOSS.
</tt><blockquote style="border-left: #5555EE solid 0.2em; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0.85em"><pre style="margin: 0em;">but at the same time I am
unhappy to see them ending in warnings to some of the participants
(and also, in a more general sense, that some people may appear
to be getting away with throw-away remarks). Maybe there is
no better solution, but...</pre><br>
<tt>  
</tt></blockquote><tt>I use View-&gt;Sort-&gt;Thread View with my mail client - ThunderBird. I 
delete all threads that I want to read.<br>
But I think one thing we should bear in mind: Keep it on topic.
</tt><blockquote style="border-left: #5555EE solid 0.2em; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0.85em"><pre style="margin: 0em;">I am wondering what is the best way for a ML subscriber to handle
this? I appreciate that getting a batch of mails on my Google account
is not the best solution, and that people who have mail accounts to
receive to can do splitting better. However, I don't want to split by
topic or by author or by keyword, I would prefer the contents of the
posts to be on-topic as far as possible (hollow laugh).</pre><br>
<tt>  
</tt></blockquote><tt>Gmail do it quite well: all email in the same thread costs on line of 
the browser.<br>
Other mailers has this function as well IMO.
</tt><blockquote style="border-left: #5555EE solid 0.2em; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0.85em"><tt>I wonder if it might be possible to split the ML more? 
</tt></blockquote><tt>No. The reasons are: We don't have that much traffic to split.
</tt><blockquote style="border-left: #5555EE solid 0.2em; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0.85em"><pre style="margin: 0em;">I am thinking
along the lines of an analogue to web forums, where sub-forums for
various off-topic, ah, topics, go, and one can have sub-forums for
flaming, trashing other OSes, political views, and so on. On the other
hand, such topics would have no place in the on-topic sub-forums, and
posts or threads could be moved between sub-forums as appropriate.
Browsing the ML would probably be a lot easier too with such
higer-level distinctions. At present, for disciplinary action, also
there seems to be only the possibility of a warning and expulsion,
which is a bit wide-ranging (shotgun against cockroach sort of
approach).
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">I think switching ML to a forum is an idea should be considered.</pre><br>
<tt>The good thing about a ML is that all we need is an email address. It is 
simple but some<br>
of us hates that.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>The good thing of forums are that we can do fancy grafix with it, and more.<br>
One of the forum I join lets me &quot;subscribe&quot; to any thread. By doing so, 
I receive emails<br>
notify me that someone has posted to the thread. If tlug has 1000 email 
traffic per day, switching<br>
to a forum is a must!</tt><br>
<br>
<blockquote style="border-left: #5555EE solid 0.2em; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0.85em"><tt> Furthermore, instead of temporarily suspending or killing a<br>
topic dead by order, moving it to OT would be another possible<br>
solution. If such sub-MLs were used, subscribers could possibly avoid<br>
getting drawn into OT arguments more, and exercise self-discipline.<br>
Example: poster A introduces political views into a post about a<br>
technical issue. Poster B replies to the technical issue, and then<br>
starts a thread in an OT forum on political view, quoting A's post.<br>
People who haven't subscribed to that forum/ML would never need to see<br>
it. Some rules on absolutely out of the question topics could be made,<br>
something that might become necessary if TLUG gets any larger and<br>
maybe less cohesive.<br>
  
</tt></blockquote><tt><br>I agree. Even if a thread is well quoted and on-topic but if the number 
of emails is large, it is very hard to read.<br>
Refer to recent threads.</tt><br>
