Dear Chris, Andy, and Andrew,

     I am so glad to have all those quick response. Now, I have to give my
some comments after I have tried something with all those folks' clues.

Me:
&gt; Now, from this NT machine I can see other PC's(Microsoft pals), but
&gt; not Linux servers!!!

Chris:
You need to add those linux servers to the domain via the PDC.
Ick, NT networking.  I'm ashamed to display any knowledge of how it works ;)

Me: well, it would be okay if the NT had Server in it. In my case,
Workstation. So I could not take this option.

Me:
&gt; BTW, do you think workgoupe name in Linux should be all capital
&gt; letters?

Chris:
It's case-insensitive.

Me:dahn right.

    YM&gt; Hi, I've got a problem. I installed a NT
    YM&gt; workstation(preinstalled) to my office. I am running several
    YM&gt; Linux servers with Samba daemon working all right. From
    YM&gt; windows95/98 when I click Network Icon on the desktop I can
    YM&gt; see all those servers of course. And I can log in.

    YM&gt;      Now, from this NT machine I can see other PC's(Microsoft
    YM&gt; pals), but not Linux servers!!! When I found that there was no
    YM&gt; Browser.dll in Winnt\system32\ I enlarged browser.dl_ of i386
    YM&gt; into the directry. And pachted the system with a new service
    YM&gt; pack(ver.4). But still cannot see Linux.

Yong-Ming,


Andy:
	The problem is most likely because NT, as of service pack 3,
uses encrypted passwords. You have two choices, either modify the
registry on the Window's machines to use plain text passwords, or
setup samba to use encrypted passwords. Both of these are explained on
the samba web page. ( www.samba.org ) Look under the FAQ.

You might turn up the logging on smbd and see what happens when the NT 
machine tries to connect.

Me:
Yes, I think you are right. Unlike Win95/98, NT seems to have a chastity
belt. hahahahha

    YM&gt;      BTW, do you think workgoupe name in Linux should be all
    YM&gt; capital letters?(I don't think so either. hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm).
Andy:
No.
Me:
Yup.

Regards,

	Andy

Andrew:
I fought with a similar problem when I needed to set up printing from an
NT workstation via Samba to a networked printer on our LAN.  The Samba doc
"WinNT.txt" contains a that suggests you also need to force a mount of
SOMETHING from the Samba box in your login batch file, even if you choose
to adapt the NT box for use with plain text passwords.  From the Samba
document "WinNT.txt":

Me: okay. I have to remember that.
*****

Andrew:
All versions of Windows NT prior to 4.0 Service Pack 3 could negotiate
plain text (clear text) passwords. Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 changed
this default behaviour so it now will only handle encrypted passwords.
The following registry entry change will re-enable clear text password
handling:

Run regedt32.exe and locate the hive key entry:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\system\CurrentControlSet\Services\Rdr\Parameters\

Add the following value:
        EnablePlainTextPassword:REG_DWORD=1

Alternatively, use the NT4_PlainPassword.reg file in this directory
(either
by double clicking on it, or run regedt32.exe and select "Import Registry
File" from the "Registry" Menu).

Me: Yes, I am going to do this later. Thank you. Certainly NT has got its
own securty eh?

Andrew:
The other major ramification of this feature of NT is that it can't
browse a user level non-encrypted server unless it already has a
connection open. This is because there is no spot for a password
prompt in the browser window. It works fine if you already have a
drive mounted (for example, one auto mounted on startup).

Me:
 That is RIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!! You see, as I was pissed off so much
that I changed the NT machine's workgroup name and also killed the samba
process in Linux Boxes. Then I booted up NT first and then gave the same
workgroup name which I had given to NT to Linux boxes. wowowowowoowowowowo,
NT browser instantly found his friends!!!

My conclusion at this point. Win95/98 is like a friendly labrador. Those dogs
love anyone. Now, when it comes to NT, the situation is quite opposite. NT is
like a bullterrier, don't know his master, don't know his friends unless
'first comes, first served'. i.e. When I give NT a workgroup name first and
then I give Linux boxe's smb.cnf the same name and run the process, NT can
know they are his friends. But when you give the same workgroup name which
you have given to Linux's smb.cof before, NT ignores the name. I am sure
NT needs computer's ID to browser computers which all microsoft OS must have.
So even if you search some computer and try to log in, you are ignored,
and even the computer doesn't pop up from Network Icon on display.
NT even ignores the same workgroup name unless it has got the correct/matching
ID.
So NT should run share process first and take all computers' id first,
and then that ID remains in the NT machine. You just reset the machine,
and immediately computers icon pop up!!!

*****

Andrew:
I may be misinterpreting this note; I do my best to avoid NT systems here,
don't know much about how they work, inside or out.

Me:
Well I am quite happy with Linux though I am just a fiddler. Yet those guys
in university just insist or maybe obsessed with the idea of NT's security.
When I suggest Linux because it is far more flexible and free!!!(FREE!!!)
while 300 or 400 sets of NT must cost a loooooooot not only to buy,
install, maintain, but also to fix again and again every time students
get those machine fuc**ed up, they say 'commercial ware is safe'. Well I don't 
think so. The thing is those 'managing people cannot show financial plan
with Linux to the top. That is all. ooops. I must stop here.
