And how much money would it have cost to lift those generators up and install them on the roof?

Just a thought here. If the generators were put on the roof, and the

to the generators for servicing them.

Every nuclear power plant has several buildings, not only the reactor building.

I didn't say it was stupidity. I expressly said it could not have been stupidity.

Not the dumbest idiot on the planet would be that dumb.&quot;

Sorry for reading that as you saying they were being stupid, I assumed you you were giving them the the benefit of the doubt. My mistake. :-P

Even the best
designs do fail, was this a systems failure, or was it idioticy in action?
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">
A design that fails so spectacularly as the Fukushima plant on the backup power cannot possibly have been an oversight nor stupidity. It was deliberate. They knew this would happen in the event of flooding and they simply accepted the risk to save a bit of money.
</pre></blockquote><tt>I am not so sure on this point. I have seen some great designs with

In fact several experts/engineers have come forward, both foreign and Japanese who had warned TEPCO in writing on a number of safety issues on Fukushima and other Japanese plants and they were ignored. This has been widely reported by reliable news media in the one or two years after the disaster.

The attitude at TEPCO was sloppy, they did not care about safety. It has nothing to do with technical incompetence, oversight or idiocy. It had all to do with negligent and greedy managers.

And this was precisely my point:

It has nothing to do with technical issues. The business side was the problem.\

</tt><tt>times and I can tell you how the ones I talk to (seem to) think (to my 
</tt><tt>exasperation) 10 warnings and documents showing how they have an issue, 
</tt><tt>2 or 3 reviews by others telling them they are fine and the risks are 
</tt><tt>not nearly as severe as being claimed. The business people &quot;rely&quot; on the

</tt><tt>obligations to their investors and the reports give them an actual (yes 
</tt><tt>they generally believe the reports that there is nothing to worry about) 
</tt><tt>sense of relief. So in the end nothing is done and trying to prove them 
</tt><tt>as being negligent is not likely to get traction - even after a 
</tt><tt>spectacular failure - they have reports showing that the other reports 
</tt><tt>were overblown (even if later proven to be accurate).  In fact look at

</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>   Sadly tell these type of execs they are being shortsighted or
