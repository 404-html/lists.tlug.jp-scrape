<pre>Hi Taisuke,

Thank you for your comprehensive reply!

&gt; It's a complex problem which questions multiple level of &quot;trust&quot;.
&gt; It boils down to following (in)equation:
&gt;
&gt;   verified != accountable != trustworthy
&gt;
&gt; To give out credit card #, it (company you're shopping at) must be trustworthy.
&gt; But the truth is no RootCA actually provides that. It is you who's
&gt; deciding to trust.


I see your point.  That I go to Amazon [for example] because I trust
Amazon because of their reputation and not because I trust the Root
CA.  I guess Amazon went to that Root CA because they trust it though;
for a company that earns as much money as Amazon, going to a Root CA
may not be a lot of money.

If I understand the system correctly...Amazon could have created their
own certificates and thus be their own Root CA.  But they go to
Verisign or whoever because ... I don't know why?  Could credit card
companies such as Visa impose a requirement on web-based companies to
go to a third party to obtain certificates?


&gt; I often shop at foreign web shop, but that's not because I trust it
&gt; 100%, but because I have certain level of trust to &quot;theft protection&quot;
&gt; provided by my card issuer. That allows me to shop even if I only
&gt; trust something like 85%. And most of the &quot;trust&quot; comes from its page
&gt; content and reputation, not from being &quot;verified&quot; by cert.
&gt;
&gt; Having a SSL-protected site doesn't directly increase my trust to the
&gt; shop, as it can be cheaply obtained. But it does increase my safety
&gt; from crack attempt by non-shop member. And I increase trust to the
&gt; shop by seeing that. Shop showed that it does care about customer's
&gt; safety, so I assume that shop does worth trusting more.


Hmmm, interesting point.  You're right in that is also my reasons for
going to web-based shops.

Like I said in my previous paragraph, I wonder if companies like Visa
impose some requirement on companies.  (i.e., you must use a CA from
this list of companies).  Normally, to bill a credit card, they would
need our signature; a web-based transaction bypasses this requirement
so perhaps credit card companies have a say in how companies offer
this service?


&gt; Major difference resides in human-operated part. For this part, major
&gt; commercial RootCAs do have advantage over CAcert (at the expense of
&gt; higher cost).
&gt; - As all operation is done inside its organization, they have much
&gt; fewer people to go after in case of legal conflict.
&gt; - Depending on RootCA (and type of cert), human operator can take
&gt; extra, strict  effort to verify identity.
&gt;


I see.  Yes, I guess this is what I was thinking about in terms of one
advantage of a Root CA.


&gt; Note I wrote &quot;Depending on RootCA&quot;. Today's low-cost issuers tends to
&gt; issue cert so easily, that I came to believe their reliability is
&gt; around same as CAcert.


Yes, you are right -- not all Root CAs are the same.  No doubt some
have entered the business to make money...

Would I be correct in saying that there is no special requirement to
be a Root CA issuer?  I guess rather than a web of trust, you need to
some how be reputable or offer your services for a low price in the
beginning to build up your customer base.


&gt;
&gt;   === Comparison of CAcert and &quot;Low-Cost RootCAs (LCRs)&quot; ===
&gt;  - LCRs only checks xerox-copy of ID card.
&gt;  - CAcert asks for face-to-face direct verification, by at least 3 people.
&gt;  - LCRs has shorter, and more reliable links to people to go after in
&gt; case of legal conflict.
&gt;  - CAcert has longer/complex, and less reliable links to people to go
&gt; after in case of legal conflict.
&gt;
&gt; While CAcert can be operated in slack manner, I'd rank CAcert at the
&gt; same level of these LCRs. So the idea of CAcert is that while it's
&gt; hard to be more reliable than major (highly-reputated with reliable
&gt; track record) RootCAs, it's probably possible to build &quot;good enough&quot;
&gt; RootCA with community effort (because I does provide verification to
&gt; certain degree). I don't think CAcert will replace existing RootCAs,
&gt; but it can surely be a coexisting alternative.


I see!  Yes, I was wondering what you or others thought about CAcert
versus Root CAs.  I didn't think it could replace it but I now see
what you mean -- they they should coexist.  And yes, if the LCRs have
a poor reputation and are charging money, then maybe the ranking will
be:

Root CAs &gt;= CAcert &gt;= LCRs


&gt; VeriSign (and et.al.)'s EV-SSL is an effort to add more
&gt; &quot;accountability&quot; by even more strict operation. However, it's adding
&gt; extra layer/complexity (and $$$), and I doubt if people outside tech
&gt; industry ever understands what it means anyway...


Yes, it is hard to say if what VeriSign does is justified.  However,
their existence may not be because of us [the customers] but maybe the
credit card companies and the web-based companies.  After all, if
information is stolen through a transaction, provided we did our best
(i.e., did not put our credit card numbers on our home page :-) ),
then either the credit card companies or the web-based companies will
face the financial costs (not just the money stolen, but the lost in
customers).  So...perhaps...we [the customers] don't need to
understand it.

Sometimes I find it odd that the security necessary for a web-based
transaction is higher than the 4 digits for our bank PIN.  And this
happened to me once...I noticed my credit card statement has my credit
card number except the last 4 digits; but my receipt has only the last
4 digits.  Not very secure!  One nice thing is that Japan doesn't seem
so reliant on credit cards...

Thank you for answering my question!

Ray
