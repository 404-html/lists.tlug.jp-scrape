<div dir='ltr'>My apologies for the bizarre formatting that resulted from <br>my prior post. I have no idea what caused it. I am putting <br>line breaks into my text because I was scolded for not doing <br>so at one time. I am reluctant to post because of the way <br>that looked. I have not seen other posts behaving so badly. <br>I hope this effort turns out looking a bit more prudish. <br><br>(I am using Outlook in Firefox in MintLinux 17, if that matters.)<br><br><div>"Stephen J. Turnbull" &lt;stephen@example.com&gt; writes<br><br>&gt; Of course, those are huge exaggerations.  You can't diffuse new ideas<br>&gt; if there are none.  Ridley's article is one long sequence of post hoc<br>&gt; ergo propter hoc fallacies.  That doesn't mean he's wrong.  It just<br>&gt; means tl;dr, you're gonna have to decide for yourself anyway.  Take<br>&gt; one example: it's absolutely true that X-ray crystallography was<br>&gt; invented by a bunch of silkworms and boll weevils trying to make more<br>&gt; money from their product.  But they wouldn't have got to square one if<br>&gt; it weren't for a bunch of pinhead tunnel-vision ivory-tower academics<br>&gt; who demonstrated that optics applied to X-rays, too.<br><br>Thank you for the interesting reply. I think I'll post it on the list with that <br>discussion just to see what it stirs up. You make a strong case. Clearly, <br>the new technology (esp. printing presses, steam engines) leading to the <br>economic explosion of the Industrial Revolution and up into the economic<br>growth of the 20th century (cars, telegraph, telephone, radios, rubber) <br>came from tinkerers who benefited economically from applying their <br>ideas. The waters become more muddied as we get further advanced <br>technologically with TV, flight, and computing. It seems the higher the <br>technology, the more important the research. The times may be <br>fundamentally changing.<br><br>IIRC, Einstein said that his E=mc2 was "in the ether" (of course, his ideas <br>on "the ether" are a good bit beyond my understanding) and if he hadn't <br>put it out, someone else would have because its time had come. Obviously, <br>though, basic research is important, too. The question is whether it drives<br>economic growth, and I don't think it does. What economic growth has <br>come directly from E=mc2? <br><br>&gt; The problem that Japanese academia faces is that people who are really<br>&gt; good at thinking are made to sit in meetings and write lies on forms<br>&gt; for 70% of their time.<br><br>The bane of academic existence here is those damned meetings.&nbsp; <br><br>&gt; The thing is, in the end it's not basic science OR technology<br>&gt; diffusion that generates economic growth: it's management and<br>&gt; entrepreneurship to exploit the conjunction of needs and the tech that<br>&gt; serves them.  (I know, that's heresy on a tech list.)  <br><br>This seems to me to be a chicken-or-the-egg call. I cannot imagine one<br>without the other. And  for that exploitation of the merging of needs and <br>tech  to even be possible, government needs to get out of the way at <br>least enough to let entrepreneurship flourish.<br><br>&gt; understand those well enough to teach them; you either have to have<br>&gt; native talent or a mentor (which is a very expensive way to educate<br>&gt; compared to the classroom).  Both basic and applied research in<br>&gt; communication and in business methods are needed, and (by current<br>&gt; Monkashow definitions) those are more bunkei than rikei.<br><br>It may be more expensive on the individual level, but on the societal <br>level it could make more sense to mentor fewer with higher levels of <br>ability rather than try to dumb everyone down to a mass teachable<br>level. Even on the individual level it may be more economical to mentor<br>a student in a specific business than to run him through the robot <br>machine for x number of years. I would guess that the classroom <br>approach is actually  more expensive for society as a whole. But it is <br>the societal arrangement that we have.<br><br>And a separate concern is that well over 50% of applied research in <br>soft sciences such as psychology, sociology, and related purview is <br>unadulterated bunkum that cannot be duplicated. (Ex-psych major - <br>at the undergrad level - speaking.)<br><br>--Ralph<br></div> 		 	   		  </div>
