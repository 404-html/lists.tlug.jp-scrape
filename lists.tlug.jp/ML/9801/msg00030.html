Your subject refers to Gnus, but the post doesn't mention it?

AFAIK in XEmacs Mule causes no problems for Gnus (configuration
complexities apart); I would suspect that if it's a problem in FSF
Emacs it's due to the lack of character type as discussed below.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; "Jon" == Jon Babcock &lt;jon@example.com&gt; writes:

    Jon&gt; I find that a number of those who belong to the Faith of
    Jon&gt; Emacs are crying out ... in pain. Anybody know why?

    Jon&gt; It doesn't use Unicode and the documentation is woefully
    Jon&gt; inadequate * ... I know about these.

The Unicode issue, as such, is a red herring.  Unicode is a Western
imperialist plot in the minds of many Orientals.  Europeans are not
going to change from one byte ISO 8859 encodings to two byte Unicode
encodings for most purposes; why should the Orientals be restricted to
Unicode?  And in fact there is a real loss to Orientals in using
Unicode (the "Han unification" problem), unlike the Eastern Europeans
who will have to use table-driven sorts, but otherwise lose nothing to
Unicode.  (NB.  I'm told that Ukrainians have complaints about the
Unicode implementation of Cyrillic, but this is a political issue and
could be fixed in future editions; by contrast, there isn't enough
room in a two-byte code to accomodate the Orientals.)  Allowing
Unicode as an external representation is trivial (assuming the CCL
interpreter doesn't SIGSEGV as it is prone to do), so I leave it as an
exercise for the reader :-).

The real issue is not Unicode qua Unicode; while the Europeans in
general would love to use Unicode to handle Oriental character sets,
many Orientals are adamantly opposed.  Books have been written about
how Unicode will be the demise of the Japanese language, for example.
The real issue is that the internal encoding of Mule is a string of
variable length codes rather than an array of "wide characters."  More 
about that below.

And the woeful documentation is a "feature".  Mule itself is supposed
to be transparent to the user, and the user interface aspects (Quail)
self-documenting.  Now, I have an option on the Rainbow Bridge;
anybody interested in buying shares?  :-P

What's _really_ wrong with this merger?

As for the Arcana, I am an initiate of a heretical sect (XEmacs), so I
can't say much about FuzzyFace Emacs 20.x from experience.  However,
some of the perspective from the XEmacs community may be of use.  DO
NOT quote me or use this material directly without verifying it; this
is for background only.

Further information about a lot of this can be gotten from the XEmacs
documentation.  Much of it comes from discussion on the XEmacs beta
mailing list, which as far as I know is not archived.  I would suggest
finding an archive of the FSF Emacs beta list if you can.  The Mule
developer's list has none of this stuff on it, as far as I can
remember.  Try dejanews for comp.emacs.*, too.

Going a circuitous route, the reason that XEmacs is a heresy is that
the XEmacs developers (originally Lucid, Inc; you may have heard of
LEmacs---many of these guys have migrated to Netscape; until recently
supported by Sun, especially the port of Mule to XEmacs) disagreed
with RMS about the implementation of editing primitives in the
underlying Emacs LISP language.  In particular, RMS being an "old"
LISPer believes that functions should be polymorphic because the data
is what it is (this may be a misrepresentation; it's the way I make
sense of his position).  The L/XEmacs developers, on the other hand,
felt that more strongly typed primitives were necessary.  In
particular, Emacs LISP did not, and does not, make a distinction
between a character and an integer.  XEmacs LISP does.  The separation 
of the character type and the integer type in XEmacs caused a great
amount of pain to the developers; so much so that character/integer
confusion is referred to as "Ebola":  swift and mysterious fatal
errors.

I believe this was originally done to make it easier to create an
8-bit clean XEmacs.  (I wasn't involved then.)  The purpose was
supporting Latin-1 editing cleanly.  It has recently been shown,
serendipitously, that any Latin-X character set is supported on
localized terminals.  (Mule does not support Latin-X, X != 1, very
well on a localized terminal; it has assumptions built in, in XEmacs
anyway, that make it think that TTYs are either X-Windows, or
Japanese, or Latin-1.)  This shows the strength of the character
abstraction, I think.  This made porting Mule to XEmacs easier as
well.

The point is that Mule does not admit a convenient representation of
characters as integers; in the buffer, ASCII characters are one byte,
all other one-byte characters (including Latin-1 GR) are two bytes,
and most Oriental languages are three bytes.  Some may be four or
more; I forget the details.  All multi-byte characters are (tiny)
structs; the first, so-called "leading byte", defines the character
set, the remainder gives the encoded value.  XEmacs went through the
pain of distinguishing between buffer bytes, individual characters,
and integers, and now the type conversions are built in.  Converting
the conversion functions to handle the Mule representation was
tedious, but the painful part had already been done.  The GNU project
is only now going through the painful part, and because of RMS's
objections to stronger typing, paradoxically instead of being able to
use polymorphous functions, the programmer is required to use
different functions for dealing with the same entities in different
contexts.

This is not so bad at the LISP level in XEmacs; the buffer processing
functions were converted to count Bufbytes instead of bytes, at a
fairly great efficiency cost in large files.  However, in FSF Emacs it
is very painful, since there is no Bufbyte abstraction.  Programmers
must be very careful about how they write C extensions (this is still
somewhat true in XEmacs as well; the C code is sprinkled with "this
file has been Mule-ized ... but see the comment on func()"), and in
fact I have heard that many functions are duplicated depending on
whether they treat the buffer as an array of bytes or as a string of
Mule characters.  The former is much more efficient, but the burden is
on the programmer to decide whether the semantics are correct.  This
has in fact infected the LISP level in FSF Emacs I have heard.

Apparently Erik Naggum stated on one of the Emacs newsgroups that
almost every existing .el file would need to be converted to use new
functions to handle Mule.  The LISP code would still work on ASCII
(but not Latin-1), but any other charset would have undefined results.
The painful consequences implied for Western European Emacs users are
obvious.  In XEmacs, OTOH, the LISP interface is backward compatible.

I think that covers the major cries of pain.  

Mule tries too hard to be transparent (see the discussion of
heuristics below).  I think that this is a bad design decision; simple 
heuristics just don't do a very good job in the complex world
post-Tower of Babel, where there not only isn't a single language, but 
no satisfactory Uni-code either, nor do people talk to each other
enough to really want one.  It worked quite well for Japanese, but
the only thing the Japanese are missing is a Uni-code.  ("Good grief,
Charlie Brown!")

Mule is a dancing bear, and it dances a lot better than I can.  People 
who actually use Mule have to admit, I think, that there just isn't
anything like it, not even proprietary.  Many proprietary systems
provide good bilingual support, or even Oriental language plus
Latin-1.  But truly multi-lingual?  Mule.  Gotta have it.  Gotta love
it.

But as long as I'm here....

Mule itself is not well designed, IMHO.  For example, there is no way
to get a "raw" binary buffer image in LISP (in XEmacs/Mule; I don't
know if this has been changed for FSF Emacs 20.x)---binary files are
represented as Latin-1 internally.  This means that it is a _major_
pain in the butt to implement things like MD5 signatures of non-ASCII
files efficiently.  Naive implementations give incorrect results.

Mule has a very sophisticated set of heuristics for guessing the
character set.  However, in early 1997 (when I was still using FSF
Emacs 19.34b/Mule), Mule was still occasionally screwing up on the
EUC/SJIS distinction (I haven't had to deal with SJIS in XEmacs since
last spring except for once using W3; it seems like everybody on
campus now has a mailer that sends ISO-2022-JP), and I believe this is
actually rather common for Chinese and Korean EUC, as they overlap the
Japanese EUC space (by definition) and Mule is (understandably)
Japan-centric.  Although it is simple to specify the default language
environment so that Chinese will not be mistaken for Japanese when
Chinese is the default, it is not so simple to override the heuristics
when they err in exceptional cases because the various controls
interact in complex ways.

I assume that FSF Emacs 20.x allows input methods like Canna and Wnn,
and XIM.  However, as far as I know they are not supported in the
sense that they are inaccessible from the so-called Library of Emacs
Input Methods; only Quail is.  This strikes me as obnoxious; it took
me about an hour to write the prototype LEIM interfaces to XEmacs/Mule
for SKK (the origin of Quail), Canna, and Wnn.  It really wouldn't
have been all that tough for the developers to include this support.
(XIM is much tougher, at least in XEmacs.)
