<pre>TLUG,

I run some shows at various venues where performers need to be alerted
to how much time they have left on stage. This is usually accomplished
with a red light at the back of the room that goes on when they have
30 seconds left or so.

Which is easy enough to set up, except there are lots of small issues
which actually make it kind of a hassle. The main one being that
different venues have different layouts, and where I want to be
standing to monitor the show and where I'd have to be to be in reach
of the light switch often don't go together. Then there's issues of
running extension cords everywhere...

Anyway, I was talking with a guy about making a small Android app that
could control a light or small screen from across the room. It would
be awesome to be able to press a button on my phone that starts a
preset performance time, and when it gets within 30 seconds before the
end, the red light comes on. And then I can stop, start, and reset it
from wherever I am.

Expanding on this idea, it would be cool if I could, say, have a green
light go on to signal the performance has started. Maybe have the red
light flash for a bit to get attention. Maybe have a yellow light and
then a red light to indicate different levels of time left. One could
easily expand the concept.

So, my friend said he would be interested in making the Android app to
drive this. So I've got that end sorted. The question is...

What to use for the light? We considered maybe one of those picture
frames that can receive pictures over wifi (they don't seem very
programmable), maybe a tablet device (expensive), old laptop (cheap
and old are crazy bulky), maybe there are lights controllable by
wifi...?

I looked on the net and found things similar to what I'm trying to
achieve, like this iPhone app:
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://appadvice.com/appnn/2010/10/led-lights-control-wifi-connection">http://appadvice.com/appnn/2010/10/led-lights-control-wifi-connection</a>

... but details on the hardware end of things are hard to come by.
There does seem to be whole sets of professional wifi controlled
coloured lights that are uber expensive, but are way beyond my means.

And that brings me to here. Does anyone know of any device that:

1. Does not cost a zillion yen.

2. Will receive Wifi

3. Can display colours. An led light, a small screen... just so long
as it's visible from about 10 metres away.

Anyone have any ideas? Ideally something buyable in Akihabara?

Oh... I know someone might suggest I contact Tokyo Hacker Space.
However, my experience with THS in the past is that they are very
focused on their own projects and are not really that communicative.

Anyway... I thought some guys on this list might have some ideas.

Any help would be much appreciated.
