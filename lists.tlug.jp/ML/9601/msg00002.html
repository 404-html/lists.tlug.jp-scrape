Hello, guys. I still have some questions. If you could give me your 
informative comments, I'd appreciate.

&gt; &gt;I was goning to buy a new computer through a mail order company like 
&gt; &gt;Gateway 2000, or Dell, but when I saw their price tags, I changed my 
&gt; &gt;mind.

	*Motherboard - (Intel?)
	 If anyone could explain about differences among the motherbord, I'd
	 like to hear that explanations. For instance, Intel makes "Zappa
	 Motherboards," "Endervor Motherboards," etc.. Also, what's meaning
	 of "Tritron Chipsets?"

	*BIOS - (Should I get flash BIOS? Which maker is the best?)

	*controller - (PCI EIDE controller? Which manufactuer is the best?

	*Sound Board - (cheap SoundBlaster 16-bit ok?)
	
&gt; &gt;	*Video card - ?
&gt; &gt;	*Video memory - 1MB (at least, right?)
&gt; I'd suggest at least 2MB.  I like the ATI Mach 64 card I have in one of
&gt; the machines in the office.  The ET4000/W32p board I have in my home 
&gt; machine is a good low price alternative, since it has good "DOS performance"
&gt; (i.e. writing directly into the frame buffer is fast, but the accelleration
&gt; features are nothing special).

Is having 2MB necessary? I am not a graphics designer. Also, there are 
some significant price differences among ATI Mach 64 cards because of 
VRAM-based cards and DRAM-based card. Are DRAM-based cards good enough? 
I'd like somebody to recommends some alternative boards.
 
&gt; &gt;	*CD-ROM drive - double speed (which manufacture?)
&gt; You might consider 4X. Now that the 6X and 8X drives are shipping in
&gt; volume, 4X drives have dropped significantly in price.  (Of course,
&gt; it also means that 2X drives are really cheap now.)

Do you think that it is necessary to have a 2X CD-ROM drive? I'm a 
student studying Computer Science. I mainly use my computer to program in 
C, C++, and assembly, and do some database stuff. Plus, using my home PC, 
I log on to the unix system at the university. About Linux, I just play 
with it. I've never programmed under Linux. The reason why I play with it 
is if somebody ask about Linux, I just cannot say, "What's that? I don't 
know anything about it!" Anyway, if I need a 2X CD-ROM drive, please 
explain why. It helps me to understand the unknown territory Linux! 

&gt; &gt;	*Monitor - NEC XV 14"
&gt; I've been spoiled.  I think 15" is the minimum you should consider,
&gt; with 17" being so much nicer that it is tough to recommend anything
&gt; smaller.  If you are going to be using a GUI, you need the extra
&gt; screen real estate.  I think the monitor is the most dangerous place
&gt; to compromise.

Well, Jim. I basically agree with you, but getting the NEC XV 15" monitor 
costs me $419 + $24.50 for shipping. On the other hand, the NEC XV 14" 
monitor costs me $289 + $24.50 for shipping. Also, the XV 14" monitor has 
the 13" viewing area and the XV 15" monitor has the 13.8" viewing area. 
Although it's small, I think that the NEC XV 14" monitor is good to buy, 
but I'd like to hear from anyone who disagree with me.

Sincerely,

</PRE>
