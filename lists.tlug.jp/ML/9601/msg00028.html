Ken,

&gt; You mentioned previously that you don't mind something that is a bit slower
&gt; as you have the time. Have you ever put a dollar-sign value on your time now
&gt; or what you would like your time to be worth? By doing so, you might realize
&gt; that by paying a bit more, you'll be saving quite a bit of time and the
&gt; nicer system might just pay for itself?
 
Maybe it might be true if your job is very crusial about time, such as 
stock brokers. However, I'm just a plain student and don't make much 
money, that's why I said I don't mind getting a bit shower machine 
(P-75). Please note: if I were not a student and had decent income, I 
would buy a powerful machine (P-100), but since I'm a poor student, 
somehow I have to compromise.
 
&gt; You might want to check out some books (or tapes) on Time Management, for
&gt; example Time Power by Charles Hobbes or 'self-improvement' type of books
&gt; that focus on improving one's finances, like Charles Givens' 'SuperSelf' or
&gt; 'Financial Self-Defense'. 

Sorry, I've never read any book on the subject. I know I should read 
books on the subject to optmize my use of time, but I'm too busy doing 
other things at school and at work.

&gt; Just a suggestion. I've found that each one of these books have taught me a
&gt; few things that have been more than worth the initial $10-20 investment and
&gt; time spent reading them.

I'll try to read some.

&gt; Also, other things that you might want to consider are:
&gt; 
&gt; (1) How long you expect to be using the machine? Most people say to expect a
&gt; year and a half or so. The better you do now, the longer you can put off
&gt; your next purchase.

Until I graduate (about 2 yrs). To be honest, I cannot buy a machine 
every 2 yr.
 
&gt; (2) Resale value. I never expect to be selling something that I buy and
&gt; instead plan on it being junk, back up, a gift or something to play around
&gt; with after two years, but do think about WHAT IF I were to try and sell it
&gt; later on.

Why? I don't get your point. As you know, once if we buy a computer, the 
machine is obsolete in several years, and its resell value is almost 
nothing. 

&gt; (3) Compatibility, support, etc. It saves 'time' that might be spent later
&gt; screwing around looking for the flash bios upgrades and trouble-shooting.

Yes, I agree with you, but since there are so many helpful mailing lists, 
like TLUG, is it really important? I think that one of the important 
things about vendors is how much their company is stable. I think that 
it's meaningless if the company says, "We give you lifetime support, but 
the next day if they go out of bussiness. Everything would be meaningless."  
 
&gt; I'll stop now and maybe wait and see what you or others have to say on this,
&gt; but it might be a good idea to go back and take a look at the messages from
&gt; Ted, Jim and whoever. I think that they were giving some pretty good advice.

Yes. I agree. These guys gave me *very* good advice. I'd really appreciate 
their help! I think I'll buy a new machine probably the end of this month 
or the early next month.

Kise
