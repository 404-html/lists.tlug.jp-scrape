I hope you didn't buy yet... I just read many replies, and thought I'd 
give my 2 yen opinion, since I strongly disagree with some of the other 
replies.

If you can afford it, get a Pentium 90 or faster, not because of the low 
voltage, but for the speed.  Do get EDO and pipeline cache if you can 
afford it.  Not sure where someone got the idea P90 doesn't need it.

Do get a 4x or faster CD-ROM if you are planning to do any multimedia.  
If you are just loading software, a 2x is fine.

Go SCSI, even if your motherboard has EIDE on it.  Whenever using a 
multi-tasking OS, SCSI will outperform any variety of IDE.

Soundblaster 16 Value is a good deal, and very compatible sound board.

Intel Triton motherboards come with Flash memory, if you require 
upgradability, review the flash upgrade page on Intels web site.  It can 
be very cryptic if you get a no-name Triton Pentium mb and need to 
upgrade the BIOS.

I recommend a Diamond Stealth 3200 video card, or any card with S3 968 if 
you'd like to see MPEG video on your system without a dedicated ad in board.

14" monitors are fine, watch dot pitch (&lt; .28 is preferred), and 
capability of &gt; 1024x768 non-interlaced will give a good picture.  If you 
can afford 15", 17", or 20", go for it.  Byte Magazine has a review of 
20:" monitors.

&gt; Hello, guys. I still have some questions. If you could give me your 
&gt; informative comments, I'd appreciate.

&gt; &gt; &gt;I was goning to buy a new computer through a mail order company like 
&gt; &gt; &gt;Gateway 2000, or Dell, but when I saw their price tags, I changed my 
&gt; &gt; &gt;mind.
&gt; 
&gt; 	*Motherboard - (Intel?)
&gt; 	 If anyone could explain about differences among the motherbord, I'd
&gt; 	 like to hear that explanations. For instance, Intel makes "Zappa
&gt; 	 Motherboards," "Endervor Motherboards," etc.. Also, what's meaning
&gt; 	 of "Tritron Chipsets?"
&gt; 
&gt; 	*BIOS - (Should I get flash BIOS? Which maker is the best?)
&gt; 
&gt; 	*controller - (PCI EIDE controller? Which manufactuer is the best?
&gt; 
&gt; 	*Sound Board - (cheap SoundBlaster 16-bit ok?)
&gt; 	
&gt; &gt; &gt;	*Video card - ?
&gt; &gt; &gt;	*Video memory - 1MB (at least, right?)
&gt; &gt; I'd suggest at least 2MB.  I like the ATI Mach 64 card I have in one of
&gt; &gt; the machines in the office.  The ET4000/W32p board I have in my home 
&gt; &gt; machine is a good low price alternative, since it has good "DOS 
&gt; performance"
&gt; &gt; (i.e. writing directly into the frame buffer is fast, but the 
&gt; accelleration
&gt; &gt; features are nothing special).
&gt; 
&gt; Is having 2MB necessary? I am not a graphics designer. Also, there are 
&gt; some significant price differences among ATI Mach 64 cards because of 
&gt; VRAM-based cards and DRAM-based card. Are DRAM-based cards good enough? 
&gt; I'd like somebody to recommends some alternative boards.
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; &gt;	*CD-ROM drive - double speed (which manufacture?)
&gt; &gt; You might consider 4X. Now that the 6X and 8X drives are shipping in
&gt; &gt; volume, 4X drives have dropped significantly in price.  (Of course,
&gt; &gt; it also means that 2X drives are really cheap now.)
&gt; 
&gt; Do you think that it is necessary to have a 2X CD-ROM drive? I'm a 
&gt; student studying Computer Science. I mainly use my computer to program in 
&gt; C, C++, and assembly, and do some database stuff. Plus, using my home PC, 
&gt; I log on to the unix system at the university. About Linux, I just play 
&gt; with it. I've never programmed under Linux. The reason why I play with it 
&gt; is if somebody ask about Linux, I just cannot say, "What's that? I don't 
&gt; know anything about it!" Anyway, if I need a 2X CD-ROM drive, please 
&gt; explain why. It helps me to understand the unknown territory Linux! 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;	*Monitor - NEC XV 14"
&gt; &gt; I've been spoiled.  I think 15" is the minimum you should consider,
&gt; &gt; with 17" being so much nicer that it is tough to recommend anything
&gt; &gt; smaller.  If you are going to be using a GUI, you need the extra
&gt; &gt; screen real estate.  I think the monitor is the most dangerous place
&gt; &gt; to compromise.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, Jim. I basically agree with you, but getting the NEC XV 15" monitor 
&gt; costs me $419 + $24.50 for shipping. On the other hand, the NEC XV 14" 
&gt; monitor costs me $289 + $24.50 for shipping. Also, the XV 14" monitor has 
&gt; the 13" viewing area and the XV 15" monitor has the 13.8" viewing area. 
&gt; Although it's small, I think that the NEC XV 14" monitor is good to buy, 
&gt; but I'd like to hear from anyone who disagree with me.
&gt; 
&gt; Sincerely,
&gt;
