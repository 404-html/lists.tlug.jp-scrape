Thanks simon!

I read somewhere that NTT will be providing  flat-rate DSL services at
JPY5,000 a month in Tokyo in December.

does anyone know anymore about this?

&gt; &gt; I remember a while back a bit of a discussion on DSL in Tokyo and had a
&gt; &gt; brief look at a FAQ someone was constructing at the time.  Now I cant
&gt; &gt; find that FAQ,  can someone please tell me where it is.  In addition to
&gt; &gt; this is there any general ISP FAQ for Tokyo anywhere in English?
&gt; 
&gt; It's on my hard disk. :)
&gt; 
&gt; ----------
&gt; 
&gt;         Tokyo High Speed Internet FAQ
&gt; 
&gt; 1.0 About this FAQ
&gt; 
&gt; 2.0 ISDN
&gt; 
&gt; 3.0 OCN
&gt; 
&gt; OCN is a service offered by NTT; it looks like ISDN, smells like ISDN,
&gt; and requires an ISDN terminal adapter, but it isn't ISDN. It's an
&gt; unmetered, statically allocated digital service, and comes in three
&gt; flavours: Economy is probably the one you want, but a misnomer at
&gt; 32,000Y a month.
&gt; 
&gt; This'll give you a 128kbps line which is shared between the other OCN
&gt; subscribers at your local exchange. Naturally, your actual download
&gt; rates will vary depending on how many other subscribers are on your
&gt; exchange and their bandwidth usage. Personally, I had this service in
&gt; Jiyugaoka and managed to almost always get the full bandwidth, with
&gt; downloads averaging around 10 kilobytes/s.
&gt; 
&gt; The economy service will give you 16 IP addresses, so to use them you'll
&gt; either need a router or a clever Linux box. To connect to OCN with
&gt; Linux, just use pppd and have it go off hook with "ATDT0" or similar.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, with ADSL approaching, I'd say the only reasons for getting OCN is
&gt; that you can run services freely, and that it's available pretty much
&gt; everywhere.
&gt; 
&gt; 4.0 ADSL
&gt; 
&gt; If you live in one of the following areas:
&gt; 
&gt;     Kayaba-Kabuto (Chuo-ku)
&gt;     Aoyama (Minato-ku)
&gt;     Mita (Minato-ku)
&gt;     Yotsuya (Shinjuku-ku)
&gt;     Yodobashi (Shinjuku-ku)
&gt;     Ikebukuro (Toshima-ku)
&gt; 
&gt; you're greatly in luck - it's likely there'll be an ADSL service available
&gt; to you. As the ASDL rollout continues, we can expect this list to grow.
&gt; 
&gt; As far as providers:
&gt; 
&gt;     4.1 NTT-ME
&gt; 
&gt; This is an ADSL service offered by NTT: it comes in two brands,
&gt; the "Personal" service and the "Professional".
&gt; 
&gt; The Personal service gives you one IP address at 6,890Y per
&gt; month. The Professional service is 26,400Y a month, but gives
&gt; you 13 IP addresses, your own domain, primary DNS and all the
&gt; trimmings.
&gt; 
&gt; Ayako Kato reports:
&gt; 
&gt;    The speed they advertise is 512Kbps downstream, 224Kbps upstream for this
&gt;    "personal" service I use. I usually get up to 40 - 50KB/s down at night,
&gt;    which is not bad at all. I was told it may be slower during daytime, but
&gt;    I'm never home during the day anyway. I have never felt anything was
&gt;    "slow" since I started using it.
&gt; 
&gt;    There isn't any filter that block incoming traffic to ports &lt; 1024. I have
&gt;    a few ports open on the gateway box but have never had problems reaching
&gt;    them from outside. (Configuring them correctly is a different issue. A few
&gt;    very skilled people helped me set things up and gave me tons of advice.
&gt;    Thanks Chris. :) )
&gt; 
&gt;    I can see that a lot of my neighbours (IP-address wise) are running Linux
&gt;    and have various services enabled, ... http, ftp and even telnet(!!).
&gt; 
&gt;     4.2 Tokyo Metallic
&gt; 
&gt; Tokyo Metallic (<A TARGET="_top" HREF="http://www.metallic.co.jp/">http://www.metallic.co.jp/</A>) offer a "Single 640" plan at
&gt; 5,500Y. While the address is theoretically dynamically allocated, it
&gt; seems not to change and is probably static DHCP. It used to be translated
&gt; using NAT so you couldn't connect to it from outside, but now they are
&gt; using real-world IP addresses; however, the DSL gateway they supply appears
&gt; to block well-known ports, so running servers from this is not an option.
&gt; (unless you want to run them on weird ports...)
&gt; 
&gt; According to Johnathan Shore:
&gt; 
&gt;     BTW, their service is excellent - have found that it delivers the
&gt;     advertised bandwidth (unlike many installations in the US).  I
&gt;     regularly get ~70KB/s on the 640, though you'll find that there are
&gt;     many places on the wan that cannot even sustain that.
&gt; 
&gt; Their "business plan" is an SDSL which allows you to run servers is
&gt; 32,000Y a month. (More information about this would be appreciated!)
&gt; 
&gt; 5.0 Cable Modem
&gt; 
&gt;     5.1 Tokyu Cable
&gt; 
&gt; They use some sort of IP masquerading so that hosts inside their
&gt; net can not be seeing from outside. UDP packets are blocked at
&gt; the gateway. IP addresses assigned by DHCP are in the private
&gt; address space. Their own Internet connection is provided by IIJ
&gt; through a 100Mbps link. Internally, they have a 622Mbps ATM
&gt; backbone connecting their 6 re-broadcasting stations. Bandwidth
&gt; from these stations to the cable modem is said to be 14.3Mbps
&gt; (the cable modem rental fee is included in the service, 5200 yen
&gt; per month, or 7000 yen/month for the Internet+CATV service --
&gt; CATV alone is 3800 yen/month). The cable modem brand is "Terayon"
&gt; <A TARGET="_top" HREF="http://www.terayon.com/products/cablemodem/modem.shtml">http://www.terayon.com/products/cablemodem/modem.shtml</A>
&gt; A hub can be connected to it, allowing more than one computer
&gt; to be on the net (they all get their IP addresses by DHCP).
&gt;
