<pre>Steve and I were at the Syncthing presentation last night at THS, so I
guess we're equipped to discuss it and maybe even demo it at TLUG this
weekend if anybody's interested. It sounds pretty good to me, though
there are some issues.

It's pretty easy to set up if you're willing to go with a completely
manual process via a web browser (it has an API but I don't know how
hard that is to use). I got a [Docker image] running and sync'd to one
of the demo servers in just a few minutes.

One nice feature is that you seemt to the configuration for file
versioning in a volume on a per-server basis, so you can keep lots of
old versions on your big home server but only a few or none on your
laptop.

&gt; &gt; But you can run multiple servers such that so long as any single
&gt; &gt; server is running you'll be working, can't you? I'd think that setting
&gt; &gt; up one or two in AWS and another one or two in Google Cloud would
&gt; &gt; provide pretty darn high reliablity 'out of the box' so long as you're
&gt; &gt; not making configuration changes to the servers.
&gt;
&gt; Yes, pretty much along my thoughts, though I'd use AWS and another VPS
&gt; provider (+backup).

Right. So the biggest caveat I had with Syncthing relates to this: it
runs in a loose mesh with trust transitive between all nodes and no
at-rest encryption, so once one node is compromised the whole system
is compromised. (Unlike with Dropbox or similar, it looks like you
can't easily and centrally turn off sync for malicious actor because
there is no central configuration.)

That means that you've got a fair amount of exposure should someone
get access to one of your cloud servers.

Possibly this could be mitigated significantly with the addition of
at-rest encryption by using the Syncthing volume as the underlying
storage layer for [eCryptfs] or something similar. (I'm fairly
confident in the security of eCryptfs when used properly because it's
what Google uses to encrypt the home dirs of users on Chromebooks.)

&gt; &gt;&gt; I have been toying with the idea (offering syncthing storage) for a
&gt; &gt;&gt; few months, but not looking yet for customers.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What would be the advantage here over something like Dropbox or Google
&gt; &gt; Drive?....
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Nothing much, I am prospecting new clients that does not do GSuite and
&gt; are unhappy or have no other cloud backup.
&gt; I offer &quot;real support&quot; since I am a one-man shop. (There are companies
&gt; that still prefer that)

While the real support is nice, I would personally be pretty worried
given that you'd have full access to all my files. I trust the big
providers to be able to put appropriate restrictions in place to keep
their staff from accessing my files and their systems are audited on a
regular basis.

&gt; &gt;&gt; And I hate that there is no proper support for hard links (I want to
&gt; &gt;&gt; keep a big (5-10 GB) store of things (e.g. maps) shared read-only
&gt; &gt;&gt; between many devices, with &quot;root&quot; on a server; yes this is NOT P2P
&gt; &gt;&gt; mode, but I need it).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; How do hard links help with this?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; specific example: I use OSMAnd+ (paid) on 4 different devices, it
&gt; downloads huge maps (few GB) each month. Unfortunately there are other
&gt; data in that directory (e.g. indexes) that is somewhat device
&gt; specific.
&gt; I want to download the updates only on one device, propagate to the
&gt; others and keep one copy on a server. The only workable way is to
&gt; duplicate the respective device directory to the server (say 3GB), for
&gt; each device (=12GB).
&gt; Then remembering to update only one of the devices, after
&gt; syncthing-ing to the server, semi-manually copy (i..e hardlink) the
&gt; maps to other devices folders, so they get the updates.
&gt; If hardlinks were supported (i.e. overwrite the file in place as
&gt; opposed to rm&amp;create), updating the maps on one device will magically
&gt; (via the hard link) update the rest.

Ah, I see. So the issue is that when a new version of the file is
uploaded it gets a new inode (presumably so the backup system, if
enabled, can keep the old file). What happens if you use a symlink? Is
it followed, or sync'd as a symlink? (I guess the latter would be the
behaviour we normally want.)

Still, a relatively trivial sync script running in the background
could deal with this for you. Though honestly, when you're talking
about saving only a few GB or 10s of GB of space on a server these
days, it's not something I'd be particularly worried about.
