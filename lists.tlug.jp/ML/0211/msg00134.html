&gt; Hi Everyone,
&gt;            I'm a new to this group and also newbie in
&gt; linux world.May I ask a few question.

Welcome.  
I think the archived posts from this list are working again at the tlug website - be sure to check through them to make sure you're not asking a F.A.Q. - Asking a FAQ rarely gets you the answers you were seeking...

&gt; 1..Would it be possible to run apache as standalone
&gt; server (without DNS server)?

Short answer: Yes. No problem. Use the IP address. (Start at <A  HREF="http://127.0.0.1/">http://127.0.0.1/</A> and work from there.)
Longer answer: Yes.  ;-) Your ISP does the DNS - they just give you a really ugly address and change it frequently.

What I think you meant to ask: Can I run a web server on a standard dialup/adsl connection and have people be able to find it?  Yes.  Look at Dyndns.org.  You can even run a regular-looking website (www.something.com) and maybe even other services, but I would really strongly discourage you from doing that for a while. Every service is a potential vulnerability and an potential personal embarrasment to *you*.

&gt; 2..Where should I replace IP address of my network, if
&gt; I want someone to access my server from outside?

First, how do you connect to the internet?  Via modem inside or attached to your box?  If it's some sort of DSL and you got a box from the ISP, is that box a router or a modem? (It makes a difference.)

Easiest way I can think of is to go get an account (free) at Dyndns.org and set up your address appropriately there - they have a web form that will fill in your IP address and associate it with a name, which you can then give out to friends or whatever.  You may still need to do some work - if you are using a router, do a Google search on the Brand/Model of Router and the word NAT - good place to start.

&gt; 3..Where can I get simple &quot;httpd.conf&quot; file ? The
&gt; default http.conf file have a lot of option which I
&gt; don't understand.

Don't let it scare you.  The one you have may not need any changes at all for your site. (Also make a copy *now* for backup - you'll be glad you did.)
Keep in mind that any line that begins with a `#` is just a comment - you can ignore lines that start with that for now.  
Don't delete lines - copy them, comment out the copy and *then* edit.  Makes undoing mistakes easier.  Add in your own notes as comments, like:

	#I don't understand this next line:
	#    IndexOptions FancyIndexing NameWidth=*
	# So I commented it out Nov 19th 12:02pm and replaced it with
	IndexOptions FancyIndexing

&gt; 4..Which book do you recommand to read for a begineer?
&gt; I read &quot; Sam's Teach yourself Apache-2 in 24 hrs &quot; and
&gt; did't get sence much.
&gt;   
In any endeavor such as this, I recommend &quot;Meditations&quot; by Marcus AurelIus.  It won't teach you about Apache, per se, but it's a book that everyone should read IMHO. ;-) 
Actually, I find that, for me, books pale in comparison to an afternoon of tweaking and googling for answers.
I also feel less dumb than if I just spent 5000 yen on the wrong book, which I seem to do more often than not.
If you must buy books, buy O'Reilly - they stay current for 10 years or so and look great together on a shelf.
  

&gt;    I'm running Mandrake 9.0 and Apache 1.3.X .
&gt;                       Thanks in advance for your help. 
&gt; 
OK distro to get your feet wet with Linux - I tried it for a while and didn't mind it too much.
It's not famous for servers and not too popular on this list, but if you're comfortable with it, enjoy.  You won't be alone in using it, even here on the list.
If you have another old box (P90 with a 1GB drive is plenty) I'd recommend trying to  set up a dedicated web server - get a low-wattage machine that you can afford to leave on for extended periods and pick a distro that you can customize the hell out of - strip out everything except Apache and see if you can get it working.  
Try it on your local network first, then when you get the hang of it a bit, toss it on to the web for all to see.

I'd really shy away from putting your good workstation on the net for all of the world to hack at - not until you are a bit more seasoned.

(Of course, if you just need a page on the web and don't care about the skills involved, look at having your site hosted - but I'm guessing you wouldn't have asked if that be the case...)

Cheers - 
Jim

PS - Feel free to write me (direct, not on the list)  if you need more help with this stuff.  I n the mean time, lurk a bit and get a feel for things.
