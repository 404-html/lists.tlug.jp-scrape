About Object Design, Inc.

Object Design, Inc. (NASDAQ: ODIS) develops, markets and supports the
ObjectStore database management system and related tools used to build
and deploy Internet, Intranet, and other applications.  The Company's
database products are designed to handle the data types and data
relationships found on the rapidly expanding World Wide
Web. ObjectStore provides native support for extended data types such
as image, free text, video, audio, time series, spatial, HTML, and
Java software objects, as well as for the extended relationships among
data exemplified by the non-tabular unstructured data found on the
Internet, enabling customers to build applications that would be
difficult or impossible to implement with conventional relational,
extended-relational or object-relational database management systems,
and reducing development costs and shortening the time required to
develop and deploy applications.

Since its introduction in 1990, ObjectStore has grown quickly to
become the market leader in object databases*, with more than 31% of
the market and revenues nearly three times its closest
competitor. Object Design has licensed over 20,000 copies of its
software to an installed base of more than 700 customers. In 1996,
Object Design posted worldwide revenues in excess of $38 million.

ObjectStore has been widely deployed in telecommunications, finance,
and engineering design and analysis applications, where rigorous
requirements for high performance, reliability, concurrency and
scalability must be met, and where conventional databases, due to
their limited ability to accommodate complex data and relationships,
have been unable to meet user requirements. ObjectStore's object
oriented architecture, performance, reliability and extensibility
provide a powerful solution for the rapidly evolving data management
needs of Web applications.

Object Design is headquartered in Burlington, Massachussetts and
markets its products in 25 countries worldwide through sales offices
in major US cities, wholly-owned subsidiaries in the United Kingdom,
Germany, France and Japan, and a network of distributors. Object
Design has formed strategic alliances with most major hardware
vendors, including IBM, Digital, HP, Silicon Graphics, and
Sun. SunSoft has embedded Object Design's database technology within
Solaris NEO (formerly Project DOE) to provide support for persistent
objects. This enables Solaris NEO developers to transparently preserve
and recover data that must persist between object requests.

Object Design's total solution includes comprehensive customer support
services. Its professional services program, Deployment by Design,
offers engineering assistance, on-site technical seminars, education
and training, and a 24-hour technical support hotline to ensure
success in the building and deployment of mission-critical
applications with ObjectStore. The Object Design Alliance program
unites a worldwide network of value-added resellers, systems
integrators and technology partners to provide solutions based on
ObjectStore.
