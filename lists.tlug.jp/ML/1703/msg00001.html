&gt;<br>
&gt; As Curt mentioned, there are downsides to end-to-end encryption, but<br>
&gt; if those aren&#39;t important to you, WhatsApp is best-of-breed.<br>
<br>
I&#39;ve spent the past couple of weeks trying out Signal as a replacement<br>
for Telegram. It&#39;s better than it was last time I tried this, though<br>
it still has issues.<br>
<br>
The big improvement is the synchronization of the desktop client. As<br>
I&#39;ve mentioned before, the &quot;master&quot; client is always an Android phone<br>
or iPhone: account setup and some other functionality is available<br>
only in those clients.<br>
<br>
The &quot;desktop&quot; client is a Chrome app. The first time you start it<br>
you&#39;re shown a QR code that you scan with the Signal app in your phone<br>
and then the desktop client generates a set of keys and syncs data.<br>
<br>
There are some fairly strict device limitations here. Apparently (I&#39;ve<br>
not tested this because my Nexus 10 is quite ill) you can have only<br>
one phone app installed at a time, and it must be on a phone, not a<br>
tablet or other device without PSTN connectivity. You can have<br>
multiple linked devices running the Chrome app, but no more than five.<br>
(It is, however quite easy and fairly quick to unlink a device and<br>
link a new one.)<br>
<br>
Once you&#39;ve finished linking your Chrome app you&#39;ll have your list of<br>
contacts and at least some of the settings for them (such as the<br>
colour of the chat messages fromn that user) but you won&#39;t have any<br>
chat history. You can then send and recieve messages from the client;<br>
they will immediately sync to your master device and any other device<br>
that&#39;s currently on. This sending and receiving works even if the<br>
master device is not on (though I&#39;ve only tested with it off for a<br>
short period) so you still have connectivity even if your phone is<br>
dead.<br>
<br>
When any device has been off for a short time, such as a few hours, it<br>
will re-sync when it&#39;s turned back on. I am guessing that the data for<br>
this come from the server which would be storing (encrypted) copies of<br>
your messages for a while after they&#39;ve been passed on to clients<br>
already. (I sent a message from the desktop client to both a friend<br>
and to myself in a chat with &quot;Curt J. Sampson, (Alternate Addresses)&quot;,<br>
shut down Chrome, powered my phone back on, and both arrived. I am<br>
pretty sure that all of my desktop clients were shut down when this<br>
happened.)<br>
<br>
If you have a lot of messages to re-sync this can take a few minutes<br>
and in the meantime you&#39;ll be getting quite a lot of alerts, which is<br>
mildly annoying.<br>
<br>
However, if the client has been off for a long time (in a particular<br>
inadvertantant test recently, just over ten days) no messages appear<br>
to sync at all.<br>
<br>
So, the things that are still rather annoying, more or less in order<br>
of importance:<br>
<br>
* I&#39;d really like the ability, at least once an account is set up, to<br>
avoid having a &quot;master&quot; client linked to a phone number, as well as<br>
being the only place you can do certain kinds of configuration.<br>
<br>
* Sync is better, but still not great. I&#39;d prefer if a client could<br>
contact other linked clients, either up currently or as they come up<br>
in the future, and fetch messages from them that it doesn&#39;t have. This<br>
would avoid keeping messages on the server (if that&#39;s indeed what it&#39;s<br>
doing) for longer than it takes to deliver just one copy and would let<br>
clients that have been offline for longer periods still have all the<br>
history you&#39;ve decided to keep. In fact, there&#39;s no reason that a new<br>
client shouldn&#39;t sync all the history available to it.<br>
<br>
* The inability to use my Android tablet is rather annoying. I guess<br>
the six-device limit is livable, but it&#39;s still a mild annoyance for<br>
someone like me who has ten devices (multiple OSes on a single device<br>
count as two devices) that he uses on an irregular basis.<br>
<br>
* Being a Chrome app has its good points (particularly in that it&#39;s<br>
the only thing that can run on most Chromebooks), but it comes with<br>
the usual downsides of Chrome apps: there&#39;s no status icon in the<br>
notification area of one&#39;s panel (Chrome apparently can&#39;t do this, at<br>
least not on Linux) and it&#39;s both running only when Chrome is running<br>
and keeping Chrome running when it&#39;s running.<br>
<br>
* The lack of support for `code` markdown is a lot more annoying than<br>
I&#39;d anticipated. I hadn&#39;t really realized how much I rely on this;<br>
it&#39;s a _lot_ more important to me than emoji. (Living without the rest<br>
of Markdown is ok; in fact it took me quite a while to realize that<br>
`code` and clickable links is all Telegram does as well.)<br>
<br>
* The uglyness of the UI is fairly tragic. Particularly annoying is<br>
that it wants to use up a lot of screen real estate with user names<br>
and icons, and even the messages are about 50% larger than those of<br>
Telegram. This rather hurts on smaller screens. You can make the text<br>
larger with Ctrl-plus, but Ctrl-minus doesn&#39;t work.<br>
<br>
* The inability to edit previous messages, at least for a brief period,<br>
is also pretty annoying. It&#39;s another thing I hadn&#39;t realized I need<br>
a lot until I started using chat systems that support that.<br>
<br>
Some of this I may be able to fix myself, if I get sufficiently<br>
motivated, since the client is open source.[1] Other parts are clearly<br>
more server/system dependent.<br>
<br>
Overall, Signal&#39;s finaly reached the point of being usable, if not<br>
always convenient, for most of my purposes.<br>
