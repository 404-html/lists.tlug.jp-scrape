&gt; Well I am sorry to see someone go, I am sure that anyone who has ever
&gt; started using a *nix system has looked to lists and newsgroups as a
&gt; place to get helpful advice and anyone who has actually stuck at it
&gt; has progressed from advice seeker to sharer of knowledge. 

May i say that TLUG has been serving also as a bird-of-a-feather type of
community ... as such it has unspoken traditions and its own &quot;culture&quot;
(it's such a cliche but i know no other way of putting it)

If you change jobs and go to a new office, then the first thing you do is
to try and find out how things are done there, right ?  If someone shows
you how to do something in one way, and you snap at him saying &quot;well I do
it differently, don't be arrogant&quot; then the chances are, you won't make
many friends.


&gt; Newbies, as they may be, have every right to ask questions and seek
&gt; help but they do not have any right to expect and answer.

If everyone understood that they may not necessarily get the kind of
answer they like, then it might help reduce the tension a little bit.

Everyone has disagreements at TLUG, it's just not &quot;newbies&quot;.  Please don't
take technical discussions as personal attacks. In the case of &quot;command
line&quot; thread, honestly, if you really want to get most out of Linux, then
learning CLI is really very essential, and it is a fact, rather than an
opinion.


&gt; Mr Turnbull's contribution below seems unnecessarily condescending and
&gt; would not have been missed if he had decided not to send it.

It couldn't have been more factual and constructive.  Which part exactly
did you find condescending ?

&gt; &gt; &gt; You, and people like you, are the relative newcomers here.  That
&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't mean you don't have &quot;rights&quot;---it just means that there are
&gt; &gt; &gt; existing arrangements and customs that long-timers are comfortable
&gt; &gt; &gt; with.  Make those folks uncomfortable, and they'll leave.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Leaving is relatively low-cost, too.  The &quot;arrogant snobs,&quot; pretty
&gt; &gt; &gt; much without exception, are capable of hosting their own mailing
&gt; &gt; &gt; lists.  Some of them have left TLUG (the ones I've always found most
&gt; &gt; &gt; interesting and helpful to me personally).  Let's not accelerate the
&gt; &gt; &gt; departure of the wizards; it hurts _you_ most.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Constructively, there may be better venues for questions when you
&gt; &gt; &gt; don't have the background that is expected on TLUG.  I think there's a
&gt; &gt; &gt; Tokyo PC Users group that has a rep for treating those questions
&gt; &gt; &gt; sympathetically.  Or maybe TLUG could split off a second list for
&gt; &gt; &gt; newbie questions.
