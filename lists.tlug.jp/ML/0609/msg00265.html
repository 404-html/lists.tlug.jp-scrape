TLUG,

</pre><tt>Apologies if this veers off topic, as it is more about email handling 
</tt><tt>than Linux management.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>I am involved in a few different groups which I communicate with via 
</tt><tt>various email methods, such as mailing lists, and mass BCC mailings.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>What I've noticed more and more in recent years, is that because of ever 
</tt><tt>increasing anti-spam measures, there are often cases where people don't 
</tt><tt>receive the email I send out. That an email comes from a majordomo 
</tt><tt>mailing list, or is BCC'd to them seems to be a significant factor for a 
</tt><tt>lot of email security systems.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Hotmail is particularly bad when it comes to this, and I wish I could 
</tt><tt>just tell everyone who uses Hotmail to not. But I can't really do that, 
</tt><tt>and in any case, Hotmail is certainly not the only offender.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>In cases where I'm communicating regularly with a group, this problem is 
</tt><tt>overcome eventually because if someone is not getting my messages, 
</tt><tt>they'll say &quot;hey, I never heard from you about X&quot;. In that case I can 
</tt><tt>respond directly and say &quot;well, make sure your spam settings aren't 
</tt><tt>blocking me&quot;. They'll then discover that my email is in their junk mail 
</tt><tt>folder. Thereafter it's not an issue.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>However, I am wrapping up a project that requires I send out one last 
</tt><tt>email, with some very important closing information. I have a duty here 
</tt><tt>to try my best to ensure that everyone gets this email, and I want to 
</tt><tt>make every effort to ensure that everyone gets it.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Because this last email going out is going to a group that I reach very 
</tt><tt>infrequently, and that I'm mailing from an email address most of them 
</tt><tt>don't already have, I'm worried that if I BCC it or use majordomo, up to 
</tt><tt>30% may not get it. And they aren't necessarily expecting this 
</tt><tt>particular message, so I can't rely on anyone contacting me to alert me 
</tt><tt>that they haven't got it. Nonetheless, it is certain that they would 
</tt><tt>want to receive the information I have for them, as it informs people of 
</tt><tt>the results of the project that everyone worked very hard on.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>It seems that what I need to do is ensure that my email isn't dismissed 
</tt><tt>as a mass-email scam, is to have some way of ensuring that it has a 
</tt><tt>proper &quot;To:&quot; and &quot;From:&quot; so that it looks like a direct, one to one, 
</tt><tt>mailing. And at the same time, I want to respect people's privacy by not 
</tt><tt>just throwing all the email into the &quot;To:&quot; field.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>In the case of one of my groups, I use a PHP script that reads all the 
</tt><tt>emails from a database, and sends them out one by one. I would have 
</tt><tt>thought that would do the trick. But it turns out that for some reason 
</tt><tt>those emails also get marked as spam. About a third of new members who 
</tt><tt>sign up initially complain that they don't get the message.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>So, does anyone have any idea of any scripts, tricks, or anything so 
</tt><tt>that I can feel reasonably sure that my email won't be stopped by overly 
</tt><tt>enthusiastic anti-spam measures?
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>We're talking a list of about 100 people. I could do it one by one over 
</tt><tt>time with some copying and pasting. But... well, weren't computers 
</tt><tt>invented to remove the repetition of tasks like this?
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Any advice or information would be much appreciated.

Thanks.
