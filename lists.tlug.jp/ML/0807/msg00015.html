<pre>Well, hopefully it can be held up in the Senate long enough for the next
president (hopefully Obama), to veto it, should it actually pass the
Senate.

Actually, what is Obama's stance on the matter?

PJ

&gt; Back again maybe for the last time... I will just quote the EFF on this
&gt; one. Let's all stand up for our rights.
&gt;   * ACTION ALERT: CELEBRATE THE 4TH BY TELLING YOUR SENATORS,
&gt;   &quot;DON'T SHRED THE CONSTITUTION -- REJECT TELECOM IMMUNITY!&quot;
&gt;   Now that the House has passed the FISA Amendments Act
&gt;   (FAA), the Senate is the last front remaining in the battle
&gt;   against granting immunity to telecom lawbreakers. When the
&gt;   Senate reconvenes early next week, every vote counts. This
&gt;   may be the last chance to urge your Senators to vote
&gt;   against the FISA Amendments Act and to support key
&gt;   amendments that would eliminate or weaken telecom immunity
&gt;   provisions. Contact your Senators today!

&gt;   Subject: Immunity for Illegal Net Spying by US government - Issue is
&gt; back..
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;   Just wanted to remind you all that it's been delayed since December but
&gt; the US government is still trying to pass laws to allow US ISPs and
&gt; backbone networks to conduct illegal spying of all communications going
&gt; across their network.  We have to act now to prevent this!
&gt;
&gt;   There is an online petition at
&gt; <a  href="http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2165/t/1027/campaign.jsp?campaign_KEY=22486">http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2165/t/1027/campaign.jsp?campaign_KEY=22486</a>
&gt;  Additionally if you are an American citizen, I think the quickest thing
&gt; you can do is find your home state Senator's web site (for California do
&gt; a web search for senator boxer and senator feinstein) and click on the
&gt; Email button to send them an email and just put a quick message in
&gt; saying that you urge them to reject this legislation.  You could use the
&gt; following text for instance.
&gt;     Count me as another one of your constituents opposed to immunity for
&gt; telecommunications companies that helped the Bush administration spy
&gt; on millions of American citizens.
&gt;
&gt;     By now you know all the details about the telecoms' involvement in the
&gt; National Security AgencyÂ’s warrantless wiretapping program.  No doubt
&gt; you have also heard arguments for and against immunity for the
&gt; telecommunications companies.
&gt;
&gt;     I will not repeat the arguments against immunity -- although I hope
&gt; you have thought long and hard about the news reports detailing how
&gt; some of the telecommunications companies cut off their wiretapping
&gt; services when the government failed to pay its bills on time.  This is
&gt; a sure sign that their true motivation was profits, not protecting the
&gt; nation.
&gt;
&gt;     My main reason for writing is to let you know that your constituents
&gt; care deeply about the Constitution and are outraged when their privacy
&gt; rights are violated -- either by the government or by entities working
&gt; with the government.  When such violations occur, every entity
&gt; involved should be expected to explain its actions in court.  If you
&gt; do not defend this principle, you are undermining the document that
&gt; serves as the foundation of our nation.
&gt;
&gt;     Please support the Constitution and your country by opposing immunity
&gt; for the telecommunications companies.

&gt;   Bloggers and Others Push Presidential Candidates on Immunity
&gt;   Related Issues
&gt;   NSA Spying issue overview, blog posts
&gt;   Posted by Cindy Cohn
&gt;   With Congress back in session this week and the Presidential season in
&gt; full swing, the fight to prevent the Bush administration from granting
&gt; immuniy to the telecoms for illegal spying is heating up once again.
&gt; Activists and bloggers alike are keeping the heat on.
&gt;
&gt;   First, Credo Mobile (formerly Working Assets) urged its members to write
&gt; to Senators Clinton, Obama and McCain, the three presidential candidates
&gt; who are still in the Senate and who have said they'd oppose immunity.
&gt;
&gt;   The results were tremendous: 67,000 emails were sent to the Senators.
&gt;
&gt;   Meanwhile Jane Hamsher over at Firedoglake has been urging folks to
&gt; write to former Senator Edwards. Edwards can make telecom immunity a
&gt; debate issue in for the presidential candidates who still have a vote in
&gt; Congress.
&gt;
&gt;   And of course the amazing Glenn Greenwald continues pointing out how
&gt; Senator Harry Reid has the power to help stop the immunity train by
&gt; supporting Senator Dodd and the handful of others who are willing to lay
&gt; down on the tracks, but instead seems to be shoveling in more coal.
&gt;
&gt;   This is all good news, but we're heading into another crunch time, so
&gt; even if you've already spoken out, please consider doing it again. Let
&gt; Congress know that we're still watching. www.stopthespying.org.
&gt;
&gt;   And check back to the www.stopthespying.org in the next couple of days
&gt; for another way to make your voice, and your face, heard.
