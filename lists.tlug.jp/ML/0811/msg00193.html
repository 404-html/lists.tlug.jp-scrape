The short answer: yes, this is the correct fingerprint, at the moment.

The long answer:

You're experiencing this basically because Ubuntu sucks.

This is entirely off-topic for mhailist, but quite relevant to tlug,
so I'm going to cc it there and give all the details in the hope that
someone will have some ideas.

starling.repo.cynic.net is role host that moves around between real
hosts from time to time. In this particular case, the power supply in
the box running it died yesterday morning, and so we moved the role host
to another machine.

To deal with this without pain, cynic.net is a signed DNSSEC zone, using
this key:

cynic.net.          256 3 5 &quot;BQEAAAABlZ3d9spigik6wn4JxAYG63xw47nse4haTYZSPi/8/fikhg76 SaL8Gm8rCDsbP/Fem3ZfOT+XEXLRr733m5Rl5dfsOojD2dn/UAmLUqBm wVq9gbQvSenj1ITrZkYrdnR6gY/FhlaRhGFKk+z5WoxnOku1ww/ArDJ2 Ay/L0YjuhVYPkYHXd5sp0garQsouruDfrTdBEypTjc3G1PdXQK+qh/Nm nGlBXUMm8kL6+QKP+LUPBJ7vN/BKqQM6gtqv/8Z302xudFYhkG1RyHjP S1YYmRicXNeoisVNLS5VSPOs+eMdljl/BtpK59eWQX1GswFRv3fp4IgR NJlV1ZCYzjdBcQ==&quot;; # Kcynic.net.+005+29234.key

The zone contains a CNAME for starling.repo.cynic.net, which eventually
points to some host with an A record and an SSHFP record. 

If you set up bind9 with &quot;dnssec-enable yes;&quot; and &quot;dnssec-validation
yes;&quot; in your options section, and add that key line above to your
trusted-keys section in your named.conf, you will note that in lookups
(e.g., with dig and possibly the +dnssec option at the end of the
command line) the &quot;ad&quot; bit is now set, indicating that the records
have been authenticated. (Or, alternatively, you get a server failure,
perhaps indicating that someone's trying on the recently announced DNS
spoofing attack.)

With this setup, you merely have to remove any hosts with that name
from your known_hosts files, point your resolv.conf to that server,
possibly adding an &quot;options edns0&quot; line to it as well, configure ssh
with &quot;VerifyHostKeyDNS yes&quot;, and ssh (at least, not-too-old versions
of OpenSSH) will turn on the &quot;use dnssec&quot; bit in the request, look up
the SSHFP record, confirm that it's been authenticated, and use that
fingerprint. Then you can forget about server moves and known_hosts
entries and all is happy.

Except under Ubuntu.

For whatever reason, the Debian folks or the Gnu libc folks or
whomever have not for the last several years seen fit to include the
RES_USE_DNSSEC bit in their /usr/include/resolv.h or add to their
resolver the ability to turn this bit on in the request. So, despite
distributing a version of ssh that supports this functionality, many
(most? all?) Linux users can't use it.

I have a couple of bug reports filed about this, but after several weeks
I've not seen any response to the issue beyond kicking the bug reports
elsewhere.

So, I'm open to ideas for this. 

One thing that would be very cool would be to have a stand-alone program
with a working resolver library (or one just calling dig, which uses its
own non-broken resolver code, even under Ubuntu) look up SSHFP records,
ensure that they're validated, and generate known_hosts entries for
them. Unfortunately, I don't see how to do this. Ssh appears to use the
full public key in a known_hosts file, but the SSHFP record contains only
the fingerprint. So we can go from known_hosts entry to SSHFP record, but
not the other way. If you want to try it:

    echo AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAIEAvihA+Ee0wI1MOBq4WpgqQL+cG6ipyz3tz1lHvmUuVJoNEG2l74rw+aYEbBIdcRQ9KtHXcB4jMEFaoelWwccT1OUPGFPVjALW6i67OYEVNMfWRsf+wc0xeSICLc9L2EvELSMz8YH9DcfJQBlNlIISqhI+sfIaBwX7fARoWwcpOE0= | ruby -r digest/sha1 -e 'p Digest::SHA1.hexdigest($stdin.read.unpack(&quot;m&quot;)[0])'

Our current solution on Linux boxes is to run a script that that goes
through our zone file looking up the names with SSHFP records, doing an
ssh-keyscan on them, and validating the resulting known_hosts entries
against the SSHFP records. We then sign this (with PGP) and check it in.
I suppose we could make this file and its signature available at a known
URL, which would let you download and check updated versions at your
convenience.

Any other thoughts? Has anybody got enough influence with all of the
various groups responsible for the Gnu libc issue to get this fixed and
deployed in any reasonably short period of time.

It's particularly frustrating because if there were an issue like this
in NetBSD, I could have a fix commited to the NetBSD-current branch
immediately, the latest release branch within a day or two, and have it
out in the next minor release fairly quickly. I hadn't realized how much
punting goes on in the very fragmented Linux development model.
