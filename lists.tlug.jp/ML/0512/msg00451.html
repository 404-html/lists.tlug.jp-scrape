More on that book. I haven't heard anything from anyone yet, but I found 
this on-line:

Linux Quick Fix Notebook
The perfect guide for Linux system administrators who want quick, 
step-by-step answers to common problems and typical tasks.

&quot;Where has this book been all my professional life? It is about time 
someone wrote this book. The author covers many basic, practical issues 
that other authors omit in a format that makes for a great 
troubleshooting reference and for casual perusing. There are a lot of 
books available that give a broad overview of system and network 
administration, and there are a lot of detailed books on each specific 
topic covered in this book, but I don't know of any other place where I 
can get so much useful, practical information on such a wide range of 
topics in such a concise and readable form. I will highly recommend it 
to my friends and colleagues who are trying to manage their own systems. 
I am anxious to show it to our instructors who teach data communications 
and networks as a possible text or lab manual.&quot; -- Ron McCarty, 
instructor and program chair, Computer Science, Penn State Erie

&quot;This book takes a very unique approach and is very flexible. It offers 
a great deal to the home user, students, small businessesall the way to 
any Linux sys admin that needs a handy reference. I found it very 
refreshing in terms of style, stated goals, presentation, ease of use, 
direction, and the &quot;present and future&quot; value of the content. In other 
words the author is very current and knowledgeable. I would recommend 
this book to every level from programmer to manager.&quot; -- Joe Brazeal, 
Information Technician III, Southwest Power Pool

&quot;This book is an excellent resource for new Linux administrators. I was 
impressed with the comprehensive set of 35 topic chapters, making this 
book a very useful reference. I know of no other work like this.&quot; -- 
George Vish II, Linux curriculum program manager and senior education 
consultant, Hewlett-Packard Education

&quot;I would recommend this book to novice Linux users and administrators. 
It covers a lot of topics, and makes it easy for readers to follow 
along.&quot; -- Bret Strong, education consultant, Hewlett-Packard Company

&quot;Linux Quick Fix Notebook is a well-written guide to designing, 
installing, and maintaining Linux servers. Many Linux reference texts 
are just simple rewrites of Linux man and info pages, but this book 
addresses the real issues that systems administrators encounter when 
working with Linux. The author provides a pedagogical guide to learning 
Linux server administration. In addition, the book includes step-by-step 
information so that users can quickly take advantage of the best that 
open source software has to offer today. I would recommend this book to 
both beginning and intermediate users of Linux.&quot; -- Joseph Naberhaus, 
Professor of Networking, Universidad Del Mar

Author Bio
Peter Harrison has been fascinated by computers since the early 1980s. 
He was the founding president of PCJAM, Jamaica's first computer user 
group, and was the principal systems engineer responsible for the 
computerization of the island's tax collection and social security systems.

He then sought new opportunities as the western Caribbean representative 
for a Fortune 500 pharmaceuticals firm and later became the 
international sales manager for a West Indian rum company. Before moving 
to Silicon Valley he ran Trinidad and Tobago's first industrial trade 
office to Latin America.

Peter has since worked extensively in the Internet sector deploying 
large-scale data centers and Web sites. Extensive use of Linux in this 
environment combined with his varied business background has helped him 
create this highly readable book for the newbie, the techie, and their 
bosses.

In his quieter moments, Peter enjoys the art and literature of the 
Caribbean and Latin America. Long rides on his bicycle provide another 
guilty pleasure. Peter likes to relax with his family on short weekend 
trips to the many attractions of the San Francisco Bay Area.
