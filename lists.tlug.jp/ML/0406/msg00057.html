&gt; I appreciate your drawing a diagram, they're much more fun to
&gt; read than text.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Like I said in footnote [2]: &quot;Bugger me if the sweet, siren call of
&gt;&gt;&gt;ASCII art isn't nigh irresistable!&quot;. (Which, by the way, should *not*
&gt;&gt;&gt;be taken as an invitation--I have already gotten several off-list
&gt;&gt;&gt;replies ;)

&gt; &gt;So, if you desire software that is &quot;free as in beer&quot;, please refrain
&gt; &gt;from considering yourself an Open Source advocate. Say it simply:
&gt; &gt;&quot;I prefer not to pay money for software&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; That's silly.  I'm as much as an advocate for Linux as the next person
&gt; who enjoys this newsgroup.

&gt;&gt;&gt;That may be. However, your statement:

Quoth jeraldweinstein@example.com (Sun, 6 Jun 2004 10:16:47 -0700):

&gt; Suddenly, the open source (junkie) saw that something costs~!@#?
&gt; Argh!!!
&gt;&gt;&gt;which is what triggered my rant, certainly does not paint you in that
&gt;&gt;&gt;light. Here you are furthering the misconception that Open Source ==
&gt;&gt;&gt;Free (as in beer).

&gt; &gt;I am not in any way making a value judgement here
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry, but yes you are.
&gt; Pet peeves we all exercise from time to time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Re-read my post. If you still think I am insulting you in any way, you
&gt;&gt;&gt;have missed my point *completely*.

I didn't feel insulted per se, just taken aback.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Google defines the phrase &quot;value judgement&quot;[1] as:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;an assessment that reveals more about the values of the person making
 &gt;&gt;&gt;the assessment than about the reality of what is assessed&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;My values, as I expressed (rather civilly, I though) in my post, are

Yes, I think they were too.

&gt;&gt;&gt;that Open Source is:

&gt;&gt;&gt;- something that makes me a more efficient coder
&gt;&gt;&gt;- a way I see for me to do good, given my particular education and
&gt;&gt;&gt;  skillset (were I a brain surgeon, I would do some pro bono work)

&gt;&gt;&gt;And my judgement was simply:

&gt;&gt;&gt;In equating Open Source with &quot;free as in beer&quot;, you are doing the Open
&gt;&gt;&gt;Source a disservice (albeit a slight one).

&gt;&gt;&gt;I provided what I consider a logical explanation of how I arrived at my
&gt;&gt;&gt;conclusion.

&gt; &gt;not wanting to pay
&gt; &gt;for software is a completely valid point of view. 
&gt; 
&gt; If I need software, believe me I'll go through hell or highwater to
&gt; hunt it down. And I will pay for it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Again, not my point. I myself certainly place a much higher priority on
&gt;&gt;&gt;paying for food, shelter, etc than I do software. If I were hungry and
&gt;&gt;&gt;living from paycheque to paycheque, cost would certainly replace
&gt;&gt;&gt;efficiency at the top of my criteria for choosing software.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I do not consider Open Source a moral issue. What I do consider a moral
&gt;&gt;&gt;issue is Software Engineering. In today's highly automated world, bugs
i&gt;&gt;&gt;n code *can* extract a high price, [2] even in human life! [3] We
&gt;&gt;&gt;professional coders *and* our management *must* accept more
&gt;&gt;&gt;responsibility for software quality, akin to physical engineers. [4]

&gt; &gt;It just happens that
&gt; &gt;so many people equate Open Source with &quot;free as in beer&quot; that it has
&gt; &gt;become a significant problem, and a barrier to adoption in enterprise /
&gt; &gt;corporate environments.
&gt; 
&gt; It has been at once saddening and good that Open Source has become more
&gt; of an enterprise, I think.  Part of the fun of Open Source for me has been that
&gt; it used to be totally free of corporate environments where the profit motive
&gt; deadened the creativity of software developers such as yourself.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Agreed. However, the positive side of this is that some companies [5]
&gt;&gt;&gt;really seem to be getting it, and paying coders to hack on Open Source
(&gt;&gt;&gt;many in a relatively relaxed environment compared to the convention
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;wage slave&quot; coder). Some of them are even giving back to the
community! [6]

&gt; &gt;However, from the point of view of an Open Source developer[9], I can
&gt; &gt;say that the nicest contribution a user can make is an email saying
&gt; &gt;something along the lines of, &quot;Thanks for writing foo! I find it very
&gt; &gt;useful for fooing my collection of bars!&quot; He may or may not then go
&gt; &gt;on to request a feature, report a bug, or attach a patch, but it is
&gt; &gt;just the simple act of saying &quot;thank you&quot; that makes my day better.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you , Josh.  I wish I could change professions and be an Open
&gt; Source Developer like you.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I will give you the benefit of the doubt and assume that no sarcasm
&gt;&gt;&gt;was meant:

&gt;&gt;&gt;You are welcome. :)

I appreciate the moderate and reasonable attitude.  

&gt; But I can't.  I get my fix of it by trying to actively stay involved
&gt; in threads  that  I need to gather information on here in the confines
&gt; of tlug!

&gt;&gt;&gt;If you want to give back to the Open Source community, here are some
i&gt;&gt;&gt;deas:

&gt;&gt;&gt;- Monetary donations, as I expressed in my previous post.
&gt;&gt;&gt;- Participating on this and other Open Source-related mailing lists.

Done that
  &gt;&gt;&gt;Remember to post your solutions at the end of a thread so that they
  &gt;&gt;&gt;show up in the archives! (Also, as Godwin noted, do fix your
  &gt;&gt;&gt;threading, that will make the archives *a lot* easier to glean
  &gt;&gt;&gt;information from.)
Needs work
&gt;&gt;&gt;- When you attempt something new on your Unix system, keep a Captain's
  &gt;&gt;&gt;Log [7] and then post it somewhere. 

I keep my own logs, so this needs work too.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I will be happy to post Captain's
  &gt;&gt;&gt;Logs on my site [7] as long as you follow my conventions and use a
  &gt;&gt;&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License. [8]
&gt;&gt;&gt;- Submit good bug reports [9] 
Done that
&gt;&gt;&gt;and / or feature requests for the Open
 &gt;&gt;&gt; Source tools that you use the most frequently. 15 minutes of your
  &gt;&gt;&gt;time can save untold hours of collective frustration for the
  &gt;&gt;&gt;countless other users of the software.
&gt;&gt;&gt;- Document something. Anything! Submit it to the distribution [10] or

Can't wait to do this.

  &gt;&gt;&gt;author of the tool, or post it somewhere. [11]

 and this....

&gt; Jerald Weinstein M.S.

&gt;&gt;&gt;What is the Master of Science degree (hope I am not making a boneheaded
&gt;&gt;&gt;assumption here) in? I ask to segue into my last idea:

Computer Information Systems

&gt;&gt;&gt;- Think of a software tool that would make work in your field of
 &gt;&gt;&gt; expertise easier. Suggest it to your local LUG or Open Source
 &gt;&gt;&gt; developer friend. Even if the people you suggest it to are too busy
  &gt;&gt;&gt;or just not interested, the idea is out there, and I cannot think of
  &gt;&gt;&gt;how many times I have said something like, &quot;This guy Jerald Weinstein
  &gt;&gt;&gt;from the TLUG list had a pretty cool idea the other day...&quot; to a
  &gt;&gt;&gt;fellow coder. Sometimes, said coder responds, &quot;Holy shit! [12] That
 &gt;&gt;&gt; *is* a good idea. Hell, [13] it is a *great* idea! I bet I could
 &gt;&gt;&gt; hack something up...&quot; and makes a break for his keyboard, mumbling
  &gt;&gt;&gt;to herself [14] the whole way. :)
