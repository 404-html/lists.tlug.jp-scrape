&gt;&gt; Now on to more substantive issues:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Indexing approach
&gt;&gt; -----------------
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; There will probably be several indexes in the future, but currently I 
&gt;&gt; provide one way to look up Kanji: a traditional radical/stroke-count 
&gt;&gt; index. Specifically, you select the radical stroke count, then the 
&gt;&gt; radical itself, then the stroke count for the whole character, then the 
&gt;&gt; specific character that you want. Although it is a linear process and 
&gt;&gt; thus easy to understand in principle, it has the disadvantage that 
&gt;&gt; people don't know by heart how many strokes are in a character, and it 
&gt;&gt; can be very hard to figure out for the more complex ones. In a printed 
&gt;&gt; dictionary it's less of a problem because you can easily shift your eyes 
&gt;&gt; to another part of the page; in a browser I think it will be awkward at 
&gt;&gt; best.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; What other alternatives might work well (when you don't know the 
&gt;&gt; pronunciation)? I've seen Jim Breen's &quot;multi-radical&quot; method and was 
&gt;&gt; initially resistant to it for a couple of reasons: first, it is 
&gt;&gt; non-linear, and thus is superficially more complex than the 
&gt;&gt; radicals/strokes method.

But MUCH more popular with the great unwashed. Some time ago I 
extracted measurements from WWWJDIC on kanji lookups. The multi-
radical method won. See: 
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/kanjindx.html">http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/kanjindx.html</a>   for a paper
about kanji indexing.

&gt;&gt; Second, I have been taught (for both Chinese and Japanese) that the 
&gt;&gt; radical is the &quot;meaning&quot; component, and that in general a character has 
&gt;&gt; exactly one radical. At any rate, I believe the radical has etymological 
&gt;&gt; significance, and that understanding which part of the Kanji is the 
&gt;&gt; radical can contribute to an overall mastery of the language. And a 
&gt;&gt; single-radical dictionary index reinforces that understanding.

Only partly true. For &quot;semasio-phonetic&quot; kanji it may provide
at least the semantic domain, but the linkage can be vague at
times.

&gt;&gt; But I'm thinking that a multi--can I say &quot;component&quot; instead of 
&gt;&gt; &quot;radical&quot;?  Then maybe I could set aside the philosophical objection. 
&gt;&gt; Anyway, a well-designed multi-thing index might after all be an easier 
&gt;&gt; way to look up Kanji.

It sure is. For WWWJDIC I hope one day to do a Java-based
version rather than the current vanilla HTML form approach.

&gt;&gt; Strokes/radicals index navigation
&gt;&gt; ---------------------------------
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; If I decide to go to a multi-component index, this might not matter any 
&gt;&gt; more. But for the moment, there is an issue with the index menus: in 
&gt;&gt; view of the fact that the user will often not be sure how many strokes 
&gt;&gt; there are in a character, I have created dynamic menus such that ... 
&gt;&gt; actually it's best if you try it out. Basically, if you move your mouse 
&gt;&gt; over an item in one row of the menu, the next row is *temporarily* 
&gt;&gt; displayed. Thus, let's say you have chosen a given radical. There is a 
&gt;&gt; row of numbers representing stroke counts of characters with that 
&gt;&gt; radical; if you run your mouse along that row you can easily see what 
&gt;&gt; characters exist for each stroke count.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; So, do you think this is (a) useful, and (b) intuitive? It would be a 
&gt;&gt; lot easier to make the menus so that the next row only changes when you 
&gt;&gt; click something. But if people find the transient display a very helpful 
&gt;&gt; feature, I will make it work.

Seems quite good so far. 

&gt;&gt; Presentation of results
&gt;&gt; -----------------------
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Currently when you select a Kanji, a request goes to the server, which 
&gt;&gt; returns a document containing all phrases that start with that Kanji. 
&gt;&gt; This document is dumped into a table with 3 columns: [Kanji] Phrase, 
&gt;&gt; Reading, and Definitions. This is reasonable in some cases, but 
&gt;&gt; sometimes the response document is quite large, so I think some kind of 
&gt;&gt; chunking and/or filtering would be helpful. It gets worse if we want to 
&gt;&gt; look up all phrases *containing* the selected character. My server-side 
&gt;&gt; script can indeed do that, but sometimes it's just way too much data, so 
&gt;&gt; I've disabled that behavior for the moment.

Comments.

- you leave out the part-of-speech, etc. Not a good idea.

- you use a comma between glosses - better to use &quot;;&quot; as commas
  occur withing glosses and it can get ambiguous.

&gt;&gt; Another issue with the result sets is that they're not sorted in any 
&gt;&gt; useful way--actually I believe they are ordered according to the JMdict 
&gt;&gt; entry sequence number.

Yes, which is a mixture of headword order (on the day it was
first built, and then historical. Not a good display order.

&gt;&gt; So, how can I improve the processing and presentation of the results?

JMdict has various frequency of use tags, which may be useful for
ordering.

I find the spaced-out table a bit clunky.

&gt;&gt; Miscellaneous technical stuff
&gt;&gt; -----------------------------
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Preparing the index: my list of radicals is derived from Jim Breen's 
&gt;&gt; KANJIDIC, but since his data is prepared for a multi-radical lookup 
&gt;&gt; system, I can't automatically extract a radicals-and-strokes index, so I 
&gt;&gt; am currently creating the index manually. 

Tsk, tsk. WWWJDIC has a page of classical radicals. See:
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/cgi-bin/wwwraddisp.cgi">http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/cgi-bin/wwwraddisp.cgi</a> The file
that built that table is used by xjdic too and is inthe xjdic
tarball.

&gt;&gt; That's why it's so incomplete, 
&gt;&gt; of course. Does anyone know of another database somewhere that list each 
&gt;&gt; kanji by (single) radical and stroke count?

Why do you need another?   8-)}

Seriously, there are a few others around, but they are (almost)
all derived from KANJIDIC.

&gt;&gt; Glyphs for radicals: if my understanding of the KANJIDIC documentation 
&gt;&gt; is correct, there is a glyph of each radical in Japanese Kanji, but some 
&gt;&gt; of them only exist in JISX-0212. 

Not even in that case. JIS212 added some, but the rest really came
later.

&gt;&gt;If so, you either have to require the 
&gt;&gt; user to have a JISX-0212 font, use images to represent some radicals, or 
&gt;&gt; use substitute glyphs from JISX-0208. The last option is not really 
&gt;&gt; acceptable, I don't think. E.g., Âåñ for &#x7BCB;&#x962A;Åè??

As you prolly know, Unicode replicated all te classical radicals
in a blockof their own.

HTH
