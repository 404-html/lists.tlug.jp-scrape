are.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;"><br>I think there are problems but many people of TLUG are working as hard
as they can to solve them. It's not a matter about _things are OK or
not_ It's about evolution. An organization and its members evolve in
time trying to adapt to the actual necessities so there will be always
something to fix. The important point is that people are trying to fix
any problem. I think that's the point.
So as a member of TLUG from many years I can say that I'm satisfied by
the way things are getting done but it doesn't mean that there are no
problems.</pre><br>
<blockquote style="border-left: #5555EE solid 0.2em; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0.85em"><pre style="margin: 0em;">As concrete examples, in the last few weeks I've been
wrestling with upgrade and swap partition issues, and I have mostly
overcome them without any assistance from TLUG. Ergo, I seem to be
doing well enough vis-&#xC3;-vis Linux in my own little way. However, it is
my essential nature to continue seeking more understanding...
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;"><br>I made questions in the past without response.
What does it means? Tlugers hate me?
No, It's just that in that moment some people didn't know the answer,
of some people didn't have time, or my question was so stupid that
nobody wanted to spend a second to answer it. That's all, there many
causes. If you don't get an answer to your problem, I think that you
have to take a look again about what did you write and how did you
make questions. Maybe it was not so clear. Or maybe it was something
that nobody knew.
In that case if you don't get an answer and you want to help improving
TLUG why not write to the list how did you solved it?</pre><br>
<blockquote style="border-left: #5555EE solid 0.2em; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0.85em"><pre style="margin: 0em;">I think if this were some sort of divorce proceedings, perhaps it
would be filed under 'uncontested for reasons of mutual
incompatibility'. TLUG will continue to do its little things, whatever
they are, and I'll do mine.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;"><br>Little things?
TLUG (Tokyo Linux User Group) it's not (The-only Linux User Group)
I mean that TLUG is made by people in free time. After 5 months for
example today is the first day I can write to the list. Other people
are more or less busy but the job is getting done as the members can.
As Josh said if you think there is a way to improve something, talk
about it. Do it. Nobody will try to stop you and any matter get voted
in the list as open the archives, as choosing a server, and so forth.
So if you think about it as a pyramid with some people in the top
deciding everything, I'm sorry but you are wrong. It's about
collaboration. So please if you have some idea or want to do
something, come on and talk about that in the list!</pre><br>
<blockquote style="border-left: #5555EE solid 0.2em; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0.85em"><pre style="margin: 0em;">Does it matter? I am certainly *NOT* claiming to be some sort of
spokesman for the big wide world beyond TLUG.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;"><br>Why not? If you want come on!
For example I have a blog as hundreds of human in this world. It has
not so many visits per day. Anyway I talk about TLUG in a post. Now
image that I receive thousands of visits per day. That means that TLUG
reach to many many people and it could spread its fame in some way.
So, what I mean, is that everybody in his/her little can do what they
considered useful.
So, I say it again, if you have some idea, talk about it and do it :-)</pre><br>

<blockquote style="border-left: #5555EE solid 0.2em; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0.85em"><pre style="margin: 0em;">Computers are a significant part of
my reality, but I don't allow them to dominate it.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;"><br>Really?
&quot;Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real?&quot;</pre><br>
<blockquote style="border-left: #5555EE solid 0.2em; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0.85em"><pre style="margin: 0em;">I always felt that one of the most preposterous criticisms of Linux
was that &quot;Linux doesn't scale for large real-world problems&quot;, but at
this point I do believe that &quot;Linux user groups don't scale to the
real world.&quot; Me? I'm still interested in the real world &#xC3;ber alles.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;"><br>So I don't want to criticize your point of view but... If you think
so, why don't do something?
For example list the things you think are wrong and try to give a
possible sollution.
Propose new initiatives.
Show to all the members the real-world problems and wake we up from this dream.
I'm seriously, please if you want or you can to improve something,
make a practical proposition, talk about it in the list. We are open
minded people, really. Come on!
I'm sorry but the only thing that is useful for nothing is say &quot;there
is a problem!&quot; and do not propose any solution or any idea to solve
it. I know that maybe there are problems nobody see and the
contribution from someone is just show to others that a problem exist,
but if you can, please do it with some idea to how solve it and
explain it in a practical way not in abstract terms.</pre><br>
