NEW WEB ADDRESS!  &lt;<A TARGET="_top" HREF="http://www.kpca.org/">http://www.kpca.org/</A>&gt;  Check it out!

          APRIL PRESENTATION:
  Title:  The Role of Intelligent Agents in Advanced Information Systems
Speaker:  Dr. Larry Kerschberg, Professor of Information Systems and
	  Systems Engineering, Center for Information Systems Integration
	  and Evolution (CISE), School of Information Technology and
	  Engineering, George Mason University
   Time:  Wednesday, April 22nd, 1998, 7:00 - 9:00 pm
   Site:  Club KARMA's event hall, 5 minutes from Osaka JR
          No charge for MEMBERS.

The Internet,  World Wide Web, Push Technology, Search Agents, On-line
Brokerage services, JAVA, Web Browsers, all point to the next generation of
Information Systems which will be open, distributed, modular, curated, and
service-oriented.  Intelligent Agents will provide the mechanism by which
we will compose our systems.

In this era of increased globalization of both the production of goods as
well as the production of information, the modern enterprise must deal with
increasing amounts of data. This data may be generated by internal
enterprise processes, by closely-associated suppliers of the enterprise, and
increasingly, by external information providers who broker their services
via the Internet and the World Wide Web.  The challenge confronting
managers is to manage information generated internally, correlate it with
publicly-available information, and use this integrated information and
knowledge to gain competitive advantage in the marketplace.

Dr. Kerschberg will present a framework for advanced information systems,
based on Intelligent Agents.  In particular, he will discuss issues in
Information Integration, Information Mediation, the stewardship of
information in agent-based information systems.  This presentation will be
interactive so as to involve the audience in discussion on these topics.

Dr. Kerschberg is influencing opinion leaders and decision makers
throughout the world. Dr. Kerschberg is Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of
Intelligent Information Systems. He has edited multiple volumes on Expert
Database Systems as well as Advanced Transaction Models and Architectures.
He has been invited to speak in England, Germany, Italy, Japan, and other
countries.
A PhD in Engineering from Case Western Reserve University, he has worked
with organizations such as Bell Labs,  EDS, CIA, Air Force labs.  A Fellow
of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science at Kyoto University, he
is a member of SIGMOD, IEEE, and American Association for Artificial
Intelligence.

MARCH PRESENTATION:
Roger Boisvert, President and Uvae Chairman of Global OnLine Japan, spoke
at the March meeting of the Kansai Professional Computing Association in
Osaka.  The interactive discussion, entitled "The Future of the Internet in
Japan", covered a wide range of developments that Mr. Boisvert expects will
have dramatic effects on the course of the industry.

In coming years, numerous factors can be expected to influence
Internet-related business in Japan.  These include fluctuations in the
exchange rate, the high cost of travel and communications, business
restructuring, global and domestic competition and, of course,
technological change.  Mr. Boisvert related some of his unique insight on
businesses from AOL to NTT, then analysed technologies from wristwatch
cellphones to low-flying satellite networks to the latest in Internet
protocols.  "Project Oxygen", an incredibly ambitious plan for a worldwide
submarine fiber-optic network and infrastructure, was singled out for
special discussion.

Former president of Tokyo PC Club and ICA, Roger Boisvert is a very
well-known figure in the Japanese computer industry.  He established the
OA/IT Group in McKinsey-Japan before moving on to create Japan's first
commercial Internet service provider, Global OnLine.  GOL is now the
largest privately-held ISP in Japan.  Whether his leg is in a cast or not,
during his spare time Mr. Boisvert can still be seen leading experts and
beginners alike up Japan's rock faces and frozen waterfalls in the Japan
Alps. Be sure to read about him in the ACCJ-Journal (1/98)
