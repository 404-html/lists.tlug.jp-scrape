Hi,
Tim Meggs kindly volunteered to be TLUG treasurer.  I wanted to solicit
opinions on the matter from everyone.  Responsibilities would include
tallying monies and receipts and posting financial summaries in some 
public place like a web page.  The treasurer would also be in charge of
distribution of funds to people for approved TLUG use.  For example,
Joe is probably going down to Akihabara to buy a disk and we need to
pay him back.  We still need to submit that donation to JLUG.  

Tim lives outside of Tokyo and may not be able to physically meet too
often, though he can probably come to most meetings.  

The way approval for spending of TLUG funds is done now is:

   1) opinions are solicited on TLUG mailing list.
   2) officers vote on issue if there are mixed opinions.  Each
	officer has one vote.  There are five officers right now.
	
There is a proposal to create a seperate TLUG administration or execution
mailing list that is open to anyone that has a strong interest in 
volunteering time and taking on responsibility.  As the group grows,
we're all interested in keeping things as free of beauracracy as possible.
However, there needs to be some amount of structure in the interest of
efficiency.

There was a discussion about splitting the list a few months ago.  At the
time, it was decided to keep the list as a single list.  However, the
subject has come up again because the main list is getting unmanagable
for some people.  Also, there is a need for more discussion on
administrative matters.  For example, how to structure the pizza
distribution and collection of pizza funds at the next meeting.  We also
need to decide things such as pizza toppings, types of soft drinks, target
cost of pizza options.   There are also numerous things like getting a
more organized checkout and checkin system for the TLUG library, targetting
different organizations for marketing...  These things are a lot of fun
and being an active member is an excellent way to make close friends
and really learn about Linux from socializing with people.  However,
this might not be interesting for everyone.  With some 150 people on the
main list, I think that many people use mail filters and scan through the
subject lines.  If we do the split, it is proposed that both lists be
archived.


Regards,
Craig
