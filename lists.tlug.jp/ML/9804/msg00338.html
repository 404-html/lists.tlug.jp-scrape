I've added a bit more information to the preliminary notes.
Feel free to distribute this freely.  Since the meeting, Tague
has moved his slides to the web, GTK 1.0 has been released,
and Fumio Chisaka has posted an explanation of compilation of
GTK with Japanese locale support.  I've included the relevant
information below.

-------------- Begin Meeting Notes --------------------

Tokyo Linux Users Group 
April 11, 1998 meeting notes
Japanese notes are available at <A TARGET="_top" HREF="http://tlug.linux.or.jp/9804/index-j.html">http://tlug.linux.or.jp/9804/index-j.html</A>

The April 11th meeting brought together over 65 Linux enthusiasts in Tokyo,
including Tague Griffith of Netscape Communication's I18N division and
Cliff Miller, President of Pacific HiTech.

We first met at 12:30 at the Yaesu Chuo ticket gate and then
went to HSBC for Domino's pizza.  The total pizza bill was divided
up among all those that ate.  

Joe Marchak, Ken Harada, and Craig Oda, (three of the infamous 
gang of five TLUG officers) hopped up and down in front
of the meeting room to kick off this grand event.  Ken gave an
amazingly good simultaneous translation session.  The bilingual
meeting was an enormous success.  

Joe Marchak made an announcement that HSBC, and therefore the
June TLUG meeting, is moving to a new building on the same street.

The big things people were there for were Pizza, Linux, and Linux-Netscape.
Shigeo Honda led a genki task-force to collate and order the proper
number of pizzas.  This came out to 1,000 yen per person.  Shigeo
volunteered to be the TLUG Snackmaster for the next meeting.  We're
discussing ways to integrate this position into the core TLUG direction
setting team.   Joe Marchak proposed the formula of  
z = (x / 2 * y + d1) / y   or (define z (/ (+ (* (/ x 2) y) d1) y))   
where

  z  = price of lunch that each TLUGer must pay
  y  = number of people eating lunch
  x  = average price per large pizza
  d1 = total price of oolong cha and soda


The large pizza prices ranged from around 2,600 to 3,600 per pizza.
I recommend putting a cap of 3,000 yen per pizza and aiming for a 
average of 2,800 yen per pizza.  This would entail ordering an equal
number of 2,600 yen and 3,000 yen pizzas.  This gives about 200 yen
per person for soft-drinks.  If we buy those 2 liter bottles of
oolong-cha, it should be enough.  So, the proposal for the next
pizza-fest is to pay 1,500 yen per person for lunch.  For this,
each person gets allocated approximately 
(+ (* 0.5 large-pizza) (* 2 cups-soft-drink))
  --  half a large pizza and a couple cups of soft drinks

If we solicit menu suggestions before the meeting, the only variable
we have to calculate at the meeting is the number of people.  With
this, it should be okay.    I think my man Shigeo's e-mail
is shige@example.com and I'm going to try to coordinate with him
before the next meeting.   I hope I got his name correct.  By the
time I started to keep track of things, the beer was flowing. 

Netscape
--------
Tague Griffith gave a tremendous talk to a full house of people.
Some things I picked up:
   UI with motif, lesstif, and GTk at a minimum.  Regardless of the
     religious feelings on UI, these three would happen at a minimum

   mozilla.org is a seperate group from Netscape.  It is intended that
   Netscape become another Mozilla distribution, in the same way that
   RedHat is another Linux distribution.  The mozilla.org group is
   intended to function as the benevolent dictator that Linus works
   as for the Linux kernel.

Tague gave out three source code CDs and dozens of Netscape pens.

The slides of the talk are in the TLUG library.  Tague has
released the slides on the net at

Linux
-----
The meeting room was hot, filled with computers and people.  Joe and I
stopped counting after we found out that over 65 TLUG members were jammed
into the meeting room in the basement of HSBC.   There was a large
showing of JLUG people including Daisuke Sato (densuke@example.com), 
core member of the
jrpm project, and Chikasaka-san (chisaka@example.com), both of who 
agreed to help setup the TLUG server, though both were drunk at the time
they agreed to do the work.   These two lads also
gave a nice demonstration of the Japanese input using the GTk graphical
widget set.  I immediately went home and compiled it with the
following:
cow:~/apps/gtk+-0.99.10$ ./configure  --enable-xim --with-locale=ja_JP --host=i586-linux-gnu

Chikasaka-san is also going to tell me how I can patch the majordomo
digest to have it support Japanese subject lines.  :-)

The Metzler brothers showed their video driver.  

jrpm now has a binary distribution of the Xlib with proper locale support.

TLUG Server
-----------
The server is now accessible at:
    <A TARGET="_top" HREF="http://tlug.linux.or.jp">http://tlug.linux.or.jp</A>
    <A TARGET="_top" HREF="http://tokyo.tlug.org">http://tokyo.tlug.org</A>
    <A TARGET="_top" HREF="http://tlug.pht.co.jp">http://tlug.pht.co.jp</A>

We are still trying to register the tlug.gr.jp setsuzoku jyouhou with JPNIC.

We plan to offer e-mail, web page and extended mailing list services to the
membership in the near future.

TPJ-JP
------
The Perl Journal Japan is a project to translate The Perl Journal
into Japanese and seek publication from a professional publisher.  
The Perl Journal Japan home page is:

    <A TARGET="_top" HREF="http://tlug.linux.or.jp/~tpj-jp">http://tlug.linux.or.jp/~tpj-jp</A>
    
The current plan is to finish the online version and then make a 
proposal to O'Reilly Japan. 


Applixware-J
------------
Applixware Japanese is out in Beta and is functional.  Cliff Miller,
president of Pacific HiTech, developers of TurboLinux, distributed
three copies of Applixware-J beta for testing.  If you received
a beta test copy, please send in a beta tester report.  

There was a nice demonstration of Applixware-J.  Pacific HiTech is 
going to distribute it for 29,800 yen at the end of May.  The
first release will not come with any import or export filters, so 
it will not be able to read and write Microsoft Office files.  However,
they are working on the filters needed to do this in the future. 

Raffle
------
The following machines were raffled off for 500 yen tickets.

3 units	      Sun SparcStation 1
7 units	      486 PC
1 unit	      IBM Multimedia machine
1 unit	      486 PC Kit

The following was given out on a random number basis.
3 units	      Netscape Source Code CD-R
3 units	      Applixware-J Beta CD-R


JLUG
----
We're proposing a minimum of 10,000 yen donation to JLUG using money
collected at the meeting.  The first round of money goes toward the
purchase of a SCSI disk for the TLUG server.  Left over money is
being sent to JLUG.


JTLUG
-----

Japan Tokyo Linux Group home page is:
      <A TARGET="_top" HREF="http://tlug.linux.or.jp/~jtlug">http://tlug.linux.or.jp/~jtlug</A>

Chisaka-san really wanted to encourage people to join jtlug.

  send e-mail to majordomo@example.com
  and include

     subscribe jtlug
     end

in the body of the message.

  jlug-tlug

One goal, two languages, this might be the simple explanation why
TLUG is seperate and independent from JLUG.  In order to facilitate
cooperation, we have formed the jtlug, where English or Japanese
are appropriate. 

     TLUG                   JTLUG               JLUG
  primarily English      mixed Japanese      primarily Japanese
  Japanese welcome        and English 
  open to Japanese
    

Clarification of TLUG
---------------------
TLUG is totally independent of JLUG and has independent meetings
and an independent structure.  Membership is free and open to
anyone.  TLUG is non-profit, non-political, and independent of
any educational or business organization.   TLUG is a loose,
100 percent volunteer organization.  Volunteers are
always welcome...   hint, hint, hint.    ;-)

Nomikai
-------
After the meeting around 20 people went to Tengu for beer and
food.  We went to an alternate Tengu that was a little further from
the station. 

Next Meeting 
------------
June 13, 1998.  12:30 at Tokyo station Yaesu chuo ticket gate.
The HSBC office has moved to a new location on the same street
as the old office. 


IRC Servers
-----------
Channel #TLUG exists on irc.karrn.ad.jp and irc.stealth.net

Financial Information
---------------------
36,009 yen was collected.


 --------- Extra Information ------------------

A few days after the meeting, GTK 1.0 was released.  Fumio Chisaka 
posted the following information on GTK to the jtlug mailing list.
