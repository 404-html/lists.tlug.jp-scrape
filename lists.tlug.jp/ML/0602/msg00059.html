<pre>
I just wrote an off-list letter to Alain about what happened after the 
Ubuntu Round Table meeting at the Grand Hyatt Tokyo hotel - which is 
situated just behind the Roppongi Hills tower (name dropping, ho-ho!) 
and it occurrs to me that it might be useful to send as a prompt for 
participation in future events!

I got started on my letter by this sentence from Alain:

&quot;I was late getting to Shinjuku but things went alright afterwards I hope. &quot;

And here's the reply that I sent him:

After that, Malcolm invited us to lunch in one of the hotel restaurants 
and events went basically like this:

1) We walked into a nice, but still semi-casual atmosphere (perfect for 
the group I think) and were given three tables.

2) Someone asked if they could be pushed together, and I was not 
surprised to see the waitress indicate that that was not allowed.

3) I sat at a table with Josh and Jun Kobayashi.  I looked at the menu 
and noticed that it indicated a set price of something like Y3,500, so I 
asked Josh &quot;Are we paying for our own lunches or is Ubuntu covering 
it?&quot;  He said he didn't know, so I suggested asking Malcolm.  Josh 
looked horrified by this proposition, but over to Malcolm I went, and 
when I asked him &quot;I'm embarrassed to ask this, but are we each paying 
for our own lunch?&quot;  He (polite man that he is) almost hid a look of 
&quot;Who is this cheap idiot?&quot; and politely said &quot;It's on us'.

4) I went back to Josh and Jun and informed them that it was being paid 
for by Ubuntu.  They both gave me a look that was half-contempt for my 
crassness and half-relief that the expensive lunch was free!  Crass me, 
I laughed at their uncomfortable pleasure in learning of the monetary 
savings!

5) At the table, as Josh and I tossed some English back and forth, I 
looked over at Jun and asked him which would be better - English or 
Japanese?  He said he couldn't understand our English, so we switched to 
Japanese.  (If you want to give Josh a bad time, ask him about his 
statement &quot;tatemono-ga-nai&quot; in referring to me!)

6) Soon after consuming mass amounts of extremely good-tasting food 
(seriously, it was really good and I really did eat a lot - half was 
ordered and half was laid out and available on an 
&quot;east-as-much-as-you-like basis), I turned around and began talking 
to... um... I think his name is Susuki?  The outgoing guy who explained 
a lot about the local scene....  As we talked about Shibuya and days 
gone by, Josh and Jun gravitated over to Malcolm's table and talked 
about something else - presumably computers.  All the while, poor Mr. 
Uchiuji (the ultra-quiet guy who sat to my left during the round-table), 
looked lost and unhappy - caught between streams of rapid English he 
didn't seem to understand on one hand, and &quot;in the old days&quot; talk (in 
Japanese) about Shibuya on the other hand.

7) We finished up, I had a very nice tasting cup of coffee, and as 
Malcolm (at the door) ogled the stunningly beautiful woman who saw us 
out of the restaurant (she was definitely a beauty), I looked back at 
her beautiful visage and back to Malcolm, who commented &quot;That woman is 
really beautiful...&quot; and I looked back for another look and muttered 
&quot;Yes... I'd like to take a picture...&quot; - at the tail end of saying that, 
I turned to see Malcolm's beautiful and friendly assistant (what was her 
name?) looking half-confused and half-displeased.  I (and maybe Malcolm 
too?) felt properly ashamed and then everyone said their good-byes and 
vanished into the Tokyo jungle.

8) Out in that jungle, I went with a few of the Japanese guys to sit in 
front of the Roppongi Hills tower (&quot;I feel like I'm in the news&quot; the men 
from Osaka commented) and then later to a coffee shop next to Suntory 
Hall where we discussed Ubuntu Linux in particular and Linux, Mac and 
hardware in general.

So... yeah, it went well I think.  The food in the restaurant was the 
best I've had in... in... months?  Years?  I wish you had come - there 
was an empty chair at our table.....

Lyle

PS - Now that I've written all this down... maybe I should sent it to 
TLUG to show what everyone missed out on?  I think I will!  Anyway, off 
it goes to you first!

PPS - and here it is......
