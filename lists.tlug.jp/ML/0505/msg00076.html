<BLOCKQUOTE>I've had similarly good experiences with installing OS 10 in Japanese<br>
on the Mac and selecting English afterwards. Going the other<br>
way--installing in English--never worked for me. The way i have it set<br>
up now, it's very easy to switch back to Japanese when necessary, and<br>
Japanese file names remain in Japanese orthography even when the menus<br>
are all in English, which is great.<br>
</BLOCKQUOTE><br>
<br>
In trying it out today, I should warn you that while all the KDE<br>
(desktop) stuff, menus, etc. switches very easily and quickly over to<br>
English from Japanese (and Japanese can be input from either position by<br>
switching text entry back and forth with Ctrl+Space), OpenOffice,<br>
FireFox &amp; Mozilla are Japanese. <br>
</BLOCKQUOTE><br>
Okay.  Thanks for letting me know.  It would be nice to have help screens in English in OO, but that's okay.  I can just connect to the internet for English help.<br>
<br>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mozilla at least can be switched over to<br>
English - folder by folder (the InBox folder, the Send folder, etc.),<br>
but I'm not sure about FireFox and I'm pretty sure you can't switch<br>
OpenOffice over - but then you can just download the English version and<br>
install that. <br>
</BLOCKQUOTE><br>
You don't think that installing two different versions of OO on the same partition would be a problem, then?<br>
Doing that with Word on the Mac is definitely a problem.  I know because i've tried it.<br>
<br>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Same with Mozilla and FireFox, but using the initial<br>
versions makes updating easier (FireFox is part of the default package<br>
install, but I had to select Mozilla).<br>
<br>
<BLOCKQUOTE>By now i've read many of the past posts in the TLUG archives relating<br>
to SuSE, and with all the trouble that people have had with previous<br>
versions of SuSE, i will not be surprised if the installation does not<br>
go smoothly, but i'm willing to experiment a little, and as long as i<br>
am able to type in Japanese relatively efficiently in a word<br>
processing application, i'll be satisfied.<br>
</BLOCKQUOTE><br>
<br>
In that case, as long as you install SuSE 9.3 in Japanese, I think<br>
you'll have no problems with Japanese text input.<br>
</BLOCKQUOTE><br>
Cool!<br>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>At first i was going to install Ubuntu in Japanese on the G3, but<br>
aborted that installation and installed on the G4 in English. The<br>
Japanese during the initial stages of the installation process on the<br>
G3 was of a low quality, i'm afraid. This is not a criticism of the<br>
producers of Ubuntu. It seems like they have created a wonderful<br>
distribution. But perhaps they have had trouble getting good<br>
translators to work for free on their project? I don't know. They will<br>
have to raise the quality of their translation, i think, though, if<br>
they're going to attract Japanese users.<br>
</BLOCKQUOTE><br>
<br>
I'm not sure the Japanese of the install steps is so great either, but<br>
get yourself through that and I think you'll like the way it works on<br>
the other side of the tunnel!<br>
</BLOCKQUOTE><br>
Okay.  I see.  <br>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>By the way, i'm still trying to decide what used, home<br>
desktop--probably Dell--to buy. Is there a quick and easy way to find<br>
out what machines SuSE runs well on? I could look at earlier posts to<br>
see what machines Lyle successfully installed SuSE on and check SuSE<br>
user forums on the internet i guess, but what i'd really like to have<br>
is a list that i can print out and take with me to Akihabara, to help<br>
guide my purchase.<br>
</BLOCKQUOTE><br>
<br>
I think anything not really really squeaky new and just coming off the<br>
assembly line should work okay for Dell desktops (but I'm not sure!). I<br>
did have some trouble with 9.1 in a slightly newer machine than the<br>
older ones I'm using in that - if you tried to install it in Japanese,<br>
it couldn't display the Japanese text of the install steps, and so the<br>
only way to install it was in English. I would think that wouldn't be a<br>
problem with 9.3, which should have better hardware support. That said,<br>
if you do find a list, I'd like to see it too!<br>
</BLOCKQUOTE><br>
Okay.  Thanks.<br>
