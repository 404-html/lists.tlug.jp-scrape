 &gt; 
Yoshihiro&gt; We need to clarify end user's environment for designing
Yoshihiro&gt; of Japanese hadling.  I considered that that is web
Yoshihiro&gt; browser, and not specified its OS / versions (because
Yoshihiro&gt; this is PHP's thread.) That's the reason why I
Yoshihiro&gt; recommended to reject characters which are not in
Yoshihiro&gt; JISX0208.
 &gt; 
 &gt; If the end user has a browser that can enter the character, she
 &gt; probably has a browser that can display it.

I think we need to add condition: &quot;with specfic user interface&quot;

 &gt; Anyway, few servers hesitate to enforce browser upgrades in order to
 &gt; create funkier displays.  &quot;Best viewed with next year's Internet
 &gt; Exploder; CANNOT be viewed with last year's anything!&quot; pages are all
 &gt; over the place, yet they can't handle users' names?

If we can limit end user, yes, we can ask user to upgrade / change their
software.

I'm considering that the service's condition is providing to various users,
various  environment (again, because this was/is PHP's thread.)
Just like this -  someone enter the data with CP932 - the other user will
lookup the information via http with web browser on MacOS with Shift-JIS
Macintosh encoding, or with various carrier's cellphone device. Or,
distribute the infomation as plain text email with iso-2022-jp.

But it seems that you're considering that the service can be restricted to
be ran on sprcific environment (i.e. specify OS, specify UI, etc.)

I think this is the divergence of our discussion.


Yoshihiro&gt; And, accepting JISX0213 characters will be a problem on
Yoshihiro&gt; backend, if backend is not designed specificallly to
Yoshihiro&gt; handle JISX0213.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Sure.  So fix the backend.  It may take time, but it's (usually) a
 &gt; much easier problem conceptually than dealing with the end user UI
 &gt; because the server owner usually owns the backend, too.

Yeah, it can be done if we stick end user's UI.


Yoshihiro&gt; I agree that if the target of the system is M18N and
Yoshihiro&gt; not L10N, unicode is the best solution.
 &gt; 
 &gt; But Unicode is no worse for L10N.  Why support both Unicode and a
 &gt; national standard?  I don't know about PHP, but the other P-languages
 &gt; commonly used to implement web applications (Perl, Python, and Puby---
 &gt; the last P is Greek) all have reasonable suites of codecs and
 &gt; well-defined ways to create new ones.  So storing internally in
 &gt; Unicode and (trivially) converting on the fly as necessary just is no
 &gt; big deal.

We still have problem in the process to trancode to Unicode. For example:

* If received data 0x8740 - is it CIRCLED DIGIT ONE (U+2460) (=Windows-31J)
  or PARENTHESIZED IDEOGRAPH SUN (U+3230) (=Mac) ? Which character was
  inputted on user's side ?

Unforuntately, there's no way to detect it correctly if we provide this
service on the Internet - it's depend on user's OS, browser, and font.
Maybe we can check User Agent for OS and browser, but no way to detect which
font is being used by user.


 &gt; But &quot;itaiji&quot; and &quot;gaiji&quot; are really a different issue, don't you
 &gt; think?  It's akin to the Western notion of a &quot;signature&quot;, which you
 &gt; could think of as creating a personal font for one's name.  I agree
 &gt; that it's very important to deal with them in Japan, and probably
 &gt; throughout the Han-using cultures.  But it should be solved in a way
 &gt; that represents the human individuality of names, not by saying that
 &gt; &quot;my ichi is a different character from your ichi&quot;.

Actually it's enough important for Japanese government work - that's the
reason why they have quiet volume of &quot;gaiji&quot; table, and using it in their
daily operations.


 &gt; Thank you for the references; I will look at them closely.  The
 &gt; question is, why doesn't JIS put its effort into standardizing this
 &gt; kind of thing, which is essentially an attempt to create a standard
 &gt; solution to the &quot;itaiji/gaiji problem&quot;, instead of deliberately
 &gt; perpetuating divergent character set standards that are at best a tiny
 &gt; improvement over Unicode?
 &gt; 
 &gt; In practice, the gaiji problem is never going to go away.  The
 &gt; non-unicode.gif table is full of recently invented scientific
 &gt; notation.  There will be more.  We need a way to represent those
 &gt; characters _as they are invented_, far more than we need &quot;maru-50&quot;, or
 &gt; even &quot;Takashimaya-no-taka&quot;.

I'm sorry but I have no idea at this point. As far as I know, I've heard that
Citizen office should accept the character if it's on dictionary.
(It's Ministry of Justice's announcement, IIRC.)

FYI, I suppose you already know of this article, but this is very intersting
- written by Katsuhiro Ogata on Impress Watch webzine,
  <A  HREF="http://internet.watch.impress.co.jp/www/column/ogata/index.htm">http://internet.watch.impress.co.jp/www/column/ogata/index.htm</A>
reported the discussion of finalizing 2000JIS and JISX0213. It seemed that
there were a not only technical discussion but also political maneuver...


Yoshihiro&gt; It's depend on target of the system.  If the service is
Yoshihiro&gt; provided to end user via web/http, and basically not
Yoshihiro&gt; restricted OS and/or environments, the safest way at
Yoshihiro&gt; this point (I don't mean in future) is, to avoid to be
Yoshihiro&gt; inserted Japanese characters which are not in JISX0208.
 &gt; 
 &gt; I don't understand this.  The worst that can happen is a couple of
 &gt; geta marks on the display.  The data on the server won't be corrupted.
 &gt; And users will quickly learn that the geta marks mean that their
 &gt; client is broken, and complain, and get them fixed.

Typically this kind of approach is taken:
Respond to user with displaying geta-mark, with annotation: &quot;the character(s)
which is(are) displayed with geta-mark indicates you that the character(s)
which you input cannot be handled on our system. Please use simplified
character, or Hira-gana or Kata-kana if it's Kanji. If it's Hankaku katakana,
please use Zenkaku katakana. Also some machine-dependent characters - like
circled numbers, roman numeric digits - are also rejected. Please use normal
arabic digits instead of.&quot;
