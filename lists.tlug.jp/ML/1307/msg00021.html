International driving permits are authorized by treaty.  I think
they're mostly between individual country-pairs.  Evidently Japan and
Brazil haven't made one.  This doesn't surprise me, there are a number
of reasons why I would expect quite a bit of official friction between
the two countries.

</pre><tt>I think you'll find that it is a far more general treaty than that -- 
</tt><tt>it's called the Treaty of Vienna, but there are a number of Treaties of 
</tt><tt>Vienna covering a wide variety of things.  Like Hague Conventions of the 
</tt><tt>modern age but more from the League of Nations time period.  Japan likes 
</tt><tt>to accept treaties conditionally.  That means that they sign them but 
</tt><tt>don't really intend to follow them too closely and do whatever they 
</tt><tt>damned well please in the name of that treaty.  Thus, if you are a 
</tt><tt>former motorcycle racer and designer who has ridden bikes of all engine 
</tt><tt>displacement class sizes since the age of 13 (mutter, mutter, mutter), 
</tt><tt>your California drivers license is only good for bikes up to 400cc 
</tt><tt>unless you take the Oogata-menkyosho test for unlimited displacement.  
</tt><tt>And they automatically fail you on the first try to teach you humility 
</tt><tt>-- or so the retired cop told me when I got pissed off and showed him a 
</tt><tt>photo of yours truly in CHP uniform astride a Kawasaki 1000 Police 
</tt><tt>Special -- after which I was told to go out and start the test bike.  
</tt><tt>The tester said &quot;Omedetou!&quot; and I had a motorcycle license. Others were 
</tt><tt>not as fortunate.  Several months later, I watched Kork Ballington, the 
</tt><tt>250cc and 350cc World Road Race Champion fail the test three times.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Brazil is also a signatory to the Vienna Convention and Brazilian 
</tt><tt>licenses can be converted to local licenses in most countries. Japan 
</tt><tt>does not recognize Brazilian licenses due to a problem created by 
</tt><tt>Japan.  During the Bubble Jidai, there was a huge need for assembly line 
</tt><tt>workers at car and car part factories, and later at electronics plants.  
</tt><tt>There weren't enough native Japanese to fill all of the factory slots, 
</tt><tt>so the government got the bright idea to go to the governments of 
</tt><tt>countries to which they'd shipped off Japanese in the early 1900s to 
</tt><tt>start farms and run shops in new lands.  Brazil has one of the largest 
</tt><tt>of these Japan expat populations and alot of those people were not ... 
</tt><tt>umm ... economically secure.  So, the bright lights at the Justice, 
</tt><tt>Labor, and Health Ministries (Labor and Health were still separate back 
</tt><tt>then) conspired to create a special visa class for the descendants of 
</tt><tt>Japanese settlers in Brazil and anyone who had a Japanese ancestor or 
</tt><tt>even a Japanese-sounding name could apply for a visa and come work in 
</tt><tt>factories mostly in Gifu, Gunma, or Aichi.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>One of the rules for allowing these people in was that they possess a 
</tt><tt>return ticket &quot;home&quot;  and that it be kept handy in case the Japanese 
</tt><tt>economy collapsed precipitously -- except there were so many safeguards 
</tt><tt>in place that no one would ever be just rounded up and shipped back 
</tt><tt>quickly.  These Brazilians were also given Japanese drivers licenses 
</tt><tt>against their Brazilian ones so that they could drive back and forth to 
</tt><tt>work.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Then the fun began.

</pre><tt>There were several dozen accidents caused by Brazilian drivers who were 
</tt><tt>either under insured or uninsured.  At least half a dozen were fatal for 
</tt><tt>a Japanese driver or passenger.  It became SOP for the Brazilian driver 
</tt><tt>to call a friend or family member from the accident site and ask them to 
</tt><tt>bring their passport, a suitcase full of clothes, and their return 
</tt><tt>ticket and give them a ride to the Nagoya Airport, from where they'd 
</tt><tt>catch the next flight(s) back to Brazil, where there was no extradition 
</tt><tt>treaty with Japan.  The news shows were making hay following Brazilian 
</tt><tt>miscreants back to various cities and following them around with open 
</tt><tt>microphones.  A couple of them were so obnoxious that the local citizens 
</tt><tt>treated them to some locally administered justice and sent them back to 
</tt><tt>Japan on stretchers.  So, the bright lights got together again and 
</tt><tt>decided that Brazilian drivers needed special attention in order to be 
</tt><tt>permitted to drive in Japan.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Short story told long.  Respectfully submitted.
