<pre>Based on what you have said, I see two possible causes:

1) The webcam has a microphone, thus sound capabilities, thus might
have taken precedence over your regular sound card (unlikely, but
possible)
2) The applications with no sound are using ALSA/OSS instead of
PulseAudio, and for some reason this fails.

Reboot your computer, open a terminal window and nothing else, then
try these commands and note whether or not they result in sound:

mplayer -ao pulse /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav
mplayer -ao alsa /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav
mplayer -ao oss /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav
aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav
paplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav
padsp mplayer -ao oss /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav

&gt; It's Summer, work is slow, so I decided to do a bunch of improvements to
&gt; my OS and hardware and broke them instead.  I've lost the ability to
&gt; listen to audio streams or hear the sound which accompanies online video
&gt; -- such as BBC and CNN news feeds.  I can hear event sounds and can hear
&gt; proper analogue stereo output through the speakers when in the Audio
&gt; Setup page.  I can also hear some event sounds in some programs -- like
&gt; the game Shisen-sho -- but not in other games with streaming audio --
&gt; like Super Tux.  I can play music CDs with Audigy, but not video DVDs
&gt; (which is Not A Big Thing since the movie DVD / Blu-Ray playing machine
&gt; is the one &quot;over there&quot; attached to the television (as HDMI 4) and has
&gt; all Medibuntu upgrades, which this &quot;work&quot; machine hasn't).
&gt;
&gt; Changes I made since having a working  Kubuntu 13.04 (five desktops) +
&gt; VirtualBox 4.1.26 running WIN XP:
&gt;
&gt; - &quot;Upgraded&quot; WIN XP to WIN 7 32-bit; but DID NOT upgrade VirtualBox (4.2
&gt; version runs flaky on this box).
&gt; - Added a webcam -- a USB Elecom UCAM-DLE-300T.
&gt; - Added an iBuffalo -- a USB microphone / headset (which I want for VOIP
&gt; use only) but kept the standard speakers, which I want to use for
&gt; regular sounds and noises (the problem began before this was installed,
&gt; I just added complexity).
&gt; - Upgraded Skype for Linux to latest version.
&gt; - Firefox may have self-upgraded to a later version during this adventure.
&gt;
&gt; PC is home built with a six-core AMD CPU and 8Gb of memory (only two
&gt; memory slots).  Main OS is Kubuntu 13.04 amd-64.  I have several issues
&gt; that have popped up but want to fix them one at a time and think that
&gt; correcting this sound issue is the most important.  I have been all over
&gt; the Kubuntu users groups for 4~5 days and don't see anything that
&gt; answers my concerns directly.
&gt;
&gt; I was having problems with buzzy speakers when they were plugged into
&gt; the mobo connections, so I dragged out my old reliable Creative Audigy
&gt; 24 PCI sound card.  Buzzing stopped.  I could play audio CDs and had
&gt; sound to accompany all Firefox video content.  In Firefox, I have
&gt; specified the VLC plugin(s) in all areas that aren't handled by Flash or
&gt; Shockwave.  When I installed WIN 7 in VirtualBox, it self-selected OSS
&gt; Audio over the old reliable PulseAudio and selected a different
&gt; controller.  After that, I had no sound in Linux, either.  I re-set the
&gt; Audio to the same sound settings as I'd had when using WIN XP as a
&gt; VirtualBox, along with all of the other &quot;old&quot; settings&quot; which worked
&gt; fine in WIN 7.
&gt;
&gt; Everything I have set up is configured for basic analogue stereo (two
&gt; front speakers).  Kubuntu &quot;sees&quot; the HDMI controller on my video card
&gt; (HDMI), which is connected to the TV (as HDMI 1) but isn't configured
&gt; for video server output ... yet.  It also sees the Audigy card (CA0106)
&gt; and headset (CM108, which is suddenly greyed out as I check while
&gt; writing this up) and sees the onboard audio when it is switched on in
&gt; BIOS (it is turned off now and was before the problem started).  I have
&gt; set preferences for the Audigy card, then HDMI, then the headset, which
&gt; Skype can't find as a discrete unit and is an upcoming problem to solve
&gt; after this one is done.
&gt;
&gt; When I restart the system, the preferred device is automatically reset
&gt; to the HDMI controller by Kubuntu.  I can play the startup sounds
&gt; through the speakers during testing but they do not play when I restart
&gt; the system.  Speakers work when I test stereo output (KDE Mixer -&gt;
&gt; Playback Streams -&gt; Settings -&gt; Audio Setup) but not in general use.
&gt;
&gt; I have reached a point where I have too much information and not enough
&gt; ideas for solutions.  Can someone else see what I am getting wrong?
