You should rip it out and rebuild it yourself anyway.  That will give you a
much better understanding of how the firewall works, and will make things
much easier if you need to debug.

I'd suggest a 2.4 kernel with iptables, as that is a much better firewall
package than 2.2 + ipchains.

&gt; Subject:	RE: Firewall setting
&gt; 
&gt; First of all, let me say thank you, Mr. Byrne and Mr. Stone,
&gt; for your prompt replies with very helpful information.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; During the install, Red Hat 7.1 gives you a choice
&gt; &gt; of no firewalling, medium security firewalling, or
&gt; &gt; maximum security firewalling.
&gt; Yes, I remember this very well. I thought it was a
&gt; good thing for users, that RedHat is giving an option
&gt; to have firewall by default (for obvious reasons).
&gt; 
&gt; I remeber putting a medium security level, but never
&gt; bothered to customize the specific ports at installation
&gt; time cuz I thought I could change it later. And I guess
&gt; the problem was that I had no idea how I was supposed
&gt; to customize it later...  (^^;;
&gt; 
&gt; you should build the firewall yourself, using the precanned one is no way
&gt; for you to understand what's going on.  If you build it yourself, you'll
&gt; be more easily able to troubleshoot it, AND you'll have a much better
&gt; understanding of how it works.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; You can find your current rules in /etc/sysconfig/ipchains.
&gt; &gt; You can find an ipchains howto in /usr/share/doc/ipchains-1.3.10.
&gt; &gt; There is also a GUI config tool called firewall-config
&gt; Yes, I checked it and found out that all the ports between
&gt; 0 and 1024 were blocked for incoming accesses.
&gt; To be sure, I changed the default port of apache from
&gt; 80 to 7000, and voir la, it works! I could access the
&gt; apache server from other computers.
&gt; 
&gt; So now I knew for sure that the firewall config was
&gt; the cause (or more like my ignorance). I actually
&gt; downloaded rpm for firewall-config to configure the
&gt; firewall setting, but I guess it was not intuitive enough
&gt; for me to use. First of all, the previous settings don't
&gt; show up in the interface just as you wrote:
&gt; &gt; noted is that if I run it, it does not seem to load my
&gt; &gt; existing /etc/sysconfig/ipchains file, yet the help from
&gt; I was hoping that I could just modify whatever was in
&gt; /etc/sysconfig/ipchains to fix the problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyways, soon enough I realized that
&gt; /etc/sysconfig/ipchains was originally configured with
&gt; /usr/sbin/lokkit (the first line of ipchains says that the
&gt; file was written by lokkit). So I used lokkit to change
&gt; the setting. It's exactly the same interface as the one
&gt; you encounter in the installation process. Very easy
&gt; to handle. I just chose the ports that I wanted to be
&gt; accessible (ssh, web server, ftp).. and it's all done.
&gt; 
&gt; Again, thanks a lot. I needed to demo some network-
&gt; related program tomorrow, and I was gonna use my
&gt; laptop to do that... (no use if it wasn't accessible from
&gt; other computers, right?)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Before I get answer, please start a new thread when
&gt; &gt; changing topics, don't just change the subject.  For
&gt; &gt; those with email clients that do threading, it creates
&gt; &gt; an ugly mess if you don't.
&gt; And I'm sorry about messing up the thread. When I
&gt; hit reply, it showed tlug@example.com at TO: field,
&gt; so I assumed it would create a new thread if I just
&gt; changed the subject of the e-mail. My bad, I'll be
&gt; careful next time.
&gt; 
&gt; -mune
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; P.S.   Do you mind if I forward your replies to other
&gt; people who have similar problems? I've actually posted
&gt; my question to my school's Linux user group. And I
&gt; haven't got really useful info. Someone also replied to
&gt; me saying that he has exactly the same problem.
&gt; 
&gt; #    I just setup a 7.1 system and I have the same problem.  I can access
&gt; the
&gt; # box from itself  i.e. ssh me works fine but from any other system it's
&gt; no
&gt; # go.  I've checked daemons, hosts.allow, hosts.deny, xinetd, emailed
&gt; redhat,
&gt; # and asked around but have no answer yet.  Please let me know if you
&gt; solve
&gt; # this.  I solved it by re-installing 7.0.
