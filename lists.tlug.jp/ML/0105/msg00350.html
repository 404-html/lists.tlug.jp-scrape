&gt; &gt; Why filter outgoing 25? Presumably you are trying to stop customers
&gt; &gt; who are potential spammers from directly sending email avoiding
&gt; &gt; your mail servers and filters. If my ISP blocked any outgoing ports
&gt; &gt; I'd move on... I consider it basic privacy and usually throw in PGP
&gt; 
&gt; You realize, of course, that the only mailservers you can connect to
&gt; on port 25 outside of your ISPs network are improperly configured
&gt; ones (yes, pop-before-smtp counts as improper configuration; it's
&gt; a total kludge and we have seen it defeated by spammers), so you
&gt; are in essence arguing in favor of open relays, at least to
&gt; some extent.  Fair enough, some people think open relays are
&gt; perfectly fine; I'm just kind of surprised to see it from you.
&gt; You seem to be a fairly anti-spam kind of guy.

Hmmm. Actually, I like to run my own mailserver on my home machine and
let that do all the work for me. I'm not talking about relaying 
just connecting point to point. Its a pretty valid thing to do I would
say and I would have thought quite normal in the community of linux
users... For the record, I would consider myself as spam hating 
as the next person out there who has had email for a couple of years
now. Don't see why I should be forced to pop before smtp if I've a
mail I wanna send right away and one of my mates has gone and sent
me some silly mpeg that eats my traffic for the next 30 minutes while
I sit there helpless.

&gt; Any argument that anyone could ever have made for allowing
&gt; outbound port 25 from a dial pool has been taken away by the
&gt; current widespread support for auth smtp.

Does my argument not count?

&gt; You'll find it more and more difficult to get an ISP that doesn't
&gt; filter outbound port 25 on their dial-up pools; many of us do it and
&gt; more get onboard all the time. 

Sad world :(

&gt; &gt; for good measure. Why not have a good policy against spammers instead
&gt; &gt; and terminate them on valid claims of spam with some extra fines 
&gt; &gt; thrown in for good measure. Freedom..
&gt; 
&gt; Because that only works after the fact (which means that it
&gt; doesn't work at all; it's kind of like having a law against
&gt; burglary but leaving your door unlocked; your stuff gets
&gt; stolen and probably never recovered, and all you can do is try to
&gt; prosecute the burglar after the fact); the spammer gets a freebie,
&gt; no matter what.  And that's all they want.  Spammers tend not
&gt; to use the same account for more than one or two runs, because
&gt; it gets terminated as soon as they're found out (well, not everywhere;
&gt; seem pretty soft on spam).  Secondly, it's very difficult to collect
&gt; those fines.   If you tell the spammer "We're billing you for $500
&gt; for excessive use of system resources, cleanup, and damage control" and
&gt; they tell you where to shove it (which they will), you'll spend
&gt; more than that trying to get the $500 from them, and there's no
&gt; guarantee of success.

Yeah, I thought that the fines are hard to get out of them :( Wouldn't
some sort of ban list between ISPs work? I mean, the spammer lives somewhere,
they register with you, you have their information, as in they're address,
telephone number, etc. Surely, they do it once within a telephone area,
account terminated and put on a shared ban list with other ISPs. If they
want reconnection then they have to dialup outside their area or steal
someone elses account. Hmmm, all possible too I guess. But still, I
ain't a fan of filtering.

&gt; You sound like a person who has never worked at an ISP.  You ought
&gt; to try it some time.  It may convert you to port 25 filtering quickly.

:) Nope, never worked for an ISP. I'd say most people sound that way
though...

&gt; We've been doing it for about two years now, and it's pretty effective.
&gt; The few spammers we've had have been forced to go through our SMTPs
&gt; and as a result were even caught in the act in several cases and
&gt; terminated while they were still sending.  And yes, it's lots of
&gt; fun to log into the RAS, cut off the spammer, see them dial in again,
&gt; cut them off again, see them dial again, cut them off again, until
&gt; the update to their account status goes into effect and they get
&gt; brushed off by the RAS  :-) 

Sounds evil *grin*
