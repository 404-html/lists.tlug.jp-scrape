Hello,
this is a draft of the TLUG June 13 meeting announcment.  Please
send me your comments at craigoda@example.com  If you find
an error, that is especially helpful.  After we check the announcement
for errors, we're going to distribute it more widely.  We should
have outlines of the talks online before the meeting.

The meeting will be in a different place across the street from
the old HSBC office.  Check the map for details.  We have a bigger
meeting room.  There is greater need for security and coordination
of cleanup activities. 

If anyone else wants to do a demonstration of something, speak up.
Incidently, I've found that MagicPoint under Linux is awesome for
presentations.  <A TARGET="_top" HREF="http://www.mew.org/mgp">http://www.mew.org/mgp</A>
The last presentation I did at ATIP on Linux was kind of weak on 
the graphics since I used HTML.  If I were to do it over again, I
would use MagicPoint.

Regards,
Craig

All Linux lovers and supporters of open source code
and free software are invited to attend
the June 13 Tokyo Linux Users Group meeting.  Membership
is open to anyone.  There are currently no membership dues.

TLUG is a non-profit, non-political organization established 
in June of 1994 to exchange information on the use of Linux 
and Free Software Foundation tools.  TLUG has an active
mailing list, home page, and regular physical meetings.  
Discussions are primarily held in English.  However, 
everyone is welcome to attend.  We especially want to encourage
Japanese people to attend and will make efforts to 
support a bilingual meeting.  

The TLUG home page is available at

-------

Most of the benefit of the meeting comes 
from chatting with other Linux users and having informal 
discussions.  Lunch is one of the main reasons for going 
to the meetings for many people.  Everyone is expected 
to pay for their own meal.

    ** Make Friends **


We will be meeting at Tokyo station on June 13th, Saturday
in front of the Tokyo station Yaesu central ticket gate at 12:30.
There is more than one Yaesu ticket gate, so be careful.  If you
know you are going and don't know what we look like, send
me an e-mail (craigoda@example.com) and I'll make sure we wait 
for you. 

Meeting Topic: 

A talk on the Debian and RPM packaging systems for Linux will be given
by Stephen Turnbull and Scott Stone.  Packaging systems allow easy 
installation and removal of Linux system.  The packaging systems
come with powerful dependencies that inform the user what other
programs are needed to ensure a functional Linux system.  For example,
the installation of the Japanese to English dicitionary xjdic is 
dependent on edict and kanjidic.  An attempt to install xjdic
with these packaging systems will result in a search of your system
for edict and kanjidic.  If the programs are not installed, the packaging
system will tell you or install them for you over the Internet or from 
CD.  The packaging systems allow the Linux user to find out information
on every program on their system, learn the contents of software packages
before installation, and find out what files were installed by what packages.
Both rpm and dpkg come with a command line interface and a menu based 
interface.

How these packaging systems can be used for development of .rpm or
.deb packages will also be covered.
