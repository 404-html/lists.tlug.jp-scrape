Hello,
I've made some changes that reflect the great suggestions from
Joe Marchak.  

I've been pondering the issue of having TLUG promote Open Software
in general.  I think it is a great idea and something that TLUG
should definitely do in the future in addition to promoting
software that works on Linux that does not come with source
code.  IMHO, TLUG should also try to promote the development of 
independent groups like The Perl Journal Japan and should cooperate 
with groups like JLUG.  

If TLUG ever becomes really big, I think that we should
encourage the development of a larger Open Software Group in
Japan.  The reason for this is that IMHO one of the major
reasons for the existence of TLUG is to talk to other people
that use Linux.  Some people may use commercial software
like Applixware-J, WordPerfect, and Empress.  Other people may
use tools like FSF Emacs, LaTeX, and PostgreSQL.  These people
may have different philosophical differences on software
licenses, but they are joined together by an interest in Linux.

So, one idea for a strategy is to: 
  o  focus on Linux and software that operates with the Linux kernel,
  o  cooperate(*) with other Linux groups in Japan including JLUG and
	other regional Linux groups,
  o  cooperate with other free software groups including Perl,
	FSF, Mozilla, BSD, and XFree86 groups,
  o  cooperate with commercial entities that promote Linux or sell
	great hardware or software for Linux. 

* cooperate would mean to try to have joint parties, nomikais and seminars 
  on certain topics when appropriate.


This is just my personal opinon on one direction TLUG could take. 

Regards,
Craig

Tokyo Linux Users Group
  Short Introduction


The Tokyo Linux Users Group was established in 1994 in order to
provide mutual technical support for users of Linux.  The first
meetings had about 5 attendees.  The group is non-profit, non-political
and offers support for all distributions of Linux.  Currently,
approximately 200 people participate in mailing lists on the
TLUG server.  An average of 30 people come to nomikais that are
held every other month and over 50 people come to Saturday meetings 
that are held in June, August, October, December, February, and April.
Membership is free, however costs for the food and drink consumed are
divided up among the people attending a meeting or a nomikai.
The group has an international orientation and over half of the
membership is non-Japanese.  The mailing list and meetings are
held in English.  However, Japanese people are encouraged to come
and will be warmly welcomed.  

Efforts are focused in two areas: 1) providing Linux services to TLUG
members, 2) coordinating member efforts to provide Linux services
to the general Linux community.  Since almost all Linux system are
used with free software from a number of groups including the FSF,
a general goal of TLUG is to promote Open Source Code Software in general.

Services offered to membership include the following:
  o  technical support on mailing list,
  o  login access to TLUG server.  e-mail account, personal home web page
     space, CGI scripting capability, access to numerous Japanese programs,
  o  access to several mailing lists including a cooperative mailing
     list with JLUG and an effort on a Japanese version of The Perl 
     Journal
  o  ability to independently create a voting poll and to vote
  o  home page space for independent groups such as the Perl Journal
     Japan and JTLUG,
  o  meetings every other month with technical talks, demonstrations of
     Linux technology, free samples of software and books, free old hardware
     donated by other members,
  o  parties every other month,
  o  access to TLUG library with free checking out of books and software.


Projects to offer services to general Linux community:
  o  Web page at <A TARGET="_top" HREF="http://tlug.linux.or.jp">http://tlug.linux.or.jp</A> with searchable archive of
     mailing lists,
  o  Online documentation in English on setup of Linux for Japanese
     support,
  o  planned FTP archive with general Japanese on Linux information
     as well as original work by TLUG members.  Once the FTP archive
     is configured it is planned to discuss the support of specific 
     software development projects,
  o  planned Japanese version of The Perl Journal 
	(<A TARGET="_top" HREF="http://tlug.linux.or.jp/~tpj-jp">http://tlug.linux.or.jp/~tpj-jp</A>).  This group is actively
	seeking volunteers.


Future Directions
-----------------
As TLUG grows, the focus of TLUG is moving from offering technical
services to the membership toward coordinating the creative energies
of the membership to contribute back to the global Linux community.
TLUG would like to contribute more to the international Linux community 
and help the development of Linux into a truly multilingual OS.  We 
also hope to assist in the smooth cooperation of the Linux community
in Japan the rest of the Linux community.  TLUG is also moving toward
support of the general Free Software movement.
