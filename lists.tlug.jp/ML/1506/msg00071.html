<pre>Good morning.

My name is Thomas, I am a native German but have been living in Japan
for 36 years. Apart from being an acupuncturist
I work here as a freelance translator for about 30 years.

That is, where the computer comes in. In the good old days a mechanical
typewriter would do just fine,
but today everybody has to use computers for everything, so that Big
Brother can be watching.

I am NOT particularly fond of computers and definitely NOT any sort of
specialist, but need to work with the computer.
I need: a wordprocessing tool â†’ for years now I have been using
LibreOffice / a mailer / a browser / a whole lot of dictionaries (I will
come to this again).
When I press the key &quot;A&quot;, I would like to get an &quot;A&quot; on my screen, if
printed on paper and be able to send (mail!) that &quot;A&quot; to whoever has
requested it.

As long as the tool(s) = computer can give me that, I am not much
interested in the inner workings of the machine and I am not really
warming up to the idea
of learning a whole new language (&quot;computer&quot;) just in order to use that
tool.


For many years now I am more or less desperately trying to get away from
Microsoft products, but Linux is definitely NOT facilitating this process.

My first encounter was with something called &quot;Linguas OS = Linux for
translators&quot; (ubuntu based).
When I found that, 7-8 years ago, I first was very excited having
finally found something just for me.

It quickly turned out, however, that I could not make it work .. AT ALL!

Since then I have been trying on an off for more than 7 years, using
multiple machines, multiple &quot;versions&quot; / &quot;flavors&quot; of Linux
(the stack of CDs/DVDs I burnt already stretches to the moon) and spend
hundreds of hours on end on my efforts; probably 50-100 times more/longer
than on all my other machines/OSs put together. And I am getting nowhere.

By now I can install the system, because I did that hundreds of times
already, but everything beyond that stage .. is an endless stream of
trouble.
One after the other. The well advertised &quot;Linux just works^TM is
something, I have not yet experienced over all these years. Sometimes I
am really asking myself, why I still keep trying.

On multiple mailing lists pertaining to the relevant flavors, I
regularly (usually very quick) am told, that if I &quot;don't know s**t about
computers, I should not dare go near the da** thing.&quot;
And/or, when I ask stupid questions like whether Linux needs antivirus
software (I asked, because I didn't/don't know), some people point out,
that the asker is probably a &quot;person of below average intelligence
(retard)&quot;. That is probably true, but not helpful.

After all this, I sometimes tend to get a little grumpy and frustrated
(showing in my language).


So, here is not THE, but MY thing.

I am almost 60 years old, have rather limited computer skills, DO NOT
understand &quot;computer mumble-jumble&quot;, but NEED a computer for work.
20 years ago I temporarily worked with Mac, but now Windows machines
(ALL translation agencies usually ask for Windows files).
And I also need some stuff, Linux apparently does not offer, like proper
dictionaries etc. THAT is, where virtual machines and Wine etc. come
into play.

Right now, my &quot;production machines&quot; are: at home = new computer running
Windows8.1, my little acupuncture clinic = Optiplex 620 still running WinXP
(I get blackmailed from the translation agencies, telling me, they will
not send me any new work, unless I &quot;upgrade&quot; my system).
Besides that I have a notebook PC running Win7; two notebooks from my
kids running kubuntu 14.04, 64-bit and xubuntu 14.04, 32-bit (Tuxtrans)
respectively.
Since &quot;Mint&quot; is the flavor that appeals to me most, I installed Mint
17.1 Cinnamon, 64-bit on the Optiplex 745, which used to be my
production machine at home.
So, this is not exactly an &quot;experimental machine&quot;.

I had hoped, I could get it up and running sufficiently, to replace the
WinXP machine.

And people on the other side of the world suggested, THIS LIST could be
place, where I can find the help I really need.

With your permission, I would like to ask a number of probably stupid
questions AND would appreciate answers in plain English
even a retard like me can understand. If it helps .. I do speak and
write Japanese and German too.

Thank you.

In the hope of not being too offensive.

Thomas
