Thanks all!

I appreciate all the replies. In particular, I appreciate some of the
important aspects on network cards mentioned by Mr. Turnbull and
Mr. Anissimov. Also, Mr. Oda, thanks for the valuable information on
phigs.

[snip]
 
&gt; where is your friend?  In Tokyo?   If he is outside of Tokyo or
&gt; Yokohama, I may be able to help him quite a bit.  Can you
&gt; send more information?  I have a bit of information
&gt; on becoming an Internet provider.

Sorry, but he currently lives in US. I don't think he wants to get into some
internet business in Japan. I talked to him several times, and he gave
me 6 months to do the research on hardware, software, services, etc...
By the way, is there any book on the subject I should read?

&gt; As far as your four PCs, connect them with ethernet and a small
&gt; hub.  Have one PC connect to a provider with a dialup serial
&gt; or ISDN connection.  This should be about 2,000-5,000 yen
&gt; per month.  What you do beyond that with IP masquerading 
&gt; would depend on your expertise.

My first goal is to get *hands-on* experiences on networking. Then my
second goal is to try to understand system administrations. If the guy
I mentioned decides to get into the internet business, I'd like
to work for his company to gain valuable networking skills. Of course,
I must have some *hands-on* experience before I work for his company. Is 
your suggestion a good place to start?

&gt;     Yuri&gt; The cheapest solution is to built 10base - BNC network, but
&gt;     Yuri&gt; try to buy cards from 3Com or Intel, or SMC only - at least
&gt;     Yuri&gt; you will save yourself from headache with drivers and driver
&gt;     Yuri&gt; updates. Cheaper cards tend to become obsolete in an year in
&gt;     Yuri&gt; average.
&gt; 
&gt; Huh?  Cheap is cheap; once you get them working they won't become
&gt; "obsolete".  Not in a home LAN!  If he can afford the resources of a
&gt; major lab to be working on state of the art applications which require
&gt; more bandwidth than even the worst of the clones from a decade ago can
&gt; supply (I still have a 1990-vintage Novell Exos-J nantoka-kantoka
&gt; "gomi-ready"-when-bought card in use) on 10Base-T, he doesn't need to
&gt; go cheap.  If he wants cheap ... on an unloaded network (3--4 boxes,
&gt; right?) I don't see the need for true multi-casts and all the high-end
&gt; stuff that the new "smart" cards can do.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, if that's what he wants to play with, he'd better get cards 
&gt; to that spec.
&gt; 
&gt; Your advice about drivers is spot-on, of course.  Incompatibilities
&gt; are the main risk to "cheap," IMO.  But the main thing is to check and
&gt; make sure there is a Linux driver with a nice fat Changelog with lots
&gt; of recent entries in it---but no major changes, and a currently valid
&gt; maintainer's address, before you buy a card ;-)

I'm confused. I don't know what to buy. Since both of you say the main
risk of cheap cards is incompatibilities, should I buy from big vendors 
such as Intel?

The reason why I want to try networking is, as I said before, to educate 
myself, and to acquire more marketable skills. In terms of this objective,
what will be the best (inexpensive) equipment to buy? Is there any good 
book on the subject I should read? 

Sincerely,

N. Kise
