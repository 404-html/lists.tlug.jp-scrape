<tt>Oh, my mail made it finally to the list! I thought it had been lost in 
</tt><tt>cyberspace for good and that I better rewrite it before posting it again 
</tt><tt>when I have calmed down. Then my English would also be more 
</tt><tt>understandable or rather I would make a clearer distinction between my 
</tt><tt>own opinion and the opinion of the reseller, like in:

</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Don't feel too sorry for the reseller.

</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>But in the meantime I got an answer in which he wrote that he does not

I'm not entirely clear on this, but it sounds as if there are three
companies involved:

    1. The TLD registry for .net, which actually distributes (or not)
    the domain information,
</pre><tt>  
</tt></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">
That would be VeriSign, responsible for net Domains?
</pre><blockquote style="border-left: #5555EE solid 0.2em; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0.85em"><pre style="margin: 0em;">
    2. The registrar for your domain, which will be one of many who
    deals with consumers directly, takes their money, and pays the
    TLD registry to enable the domain, and
</pre><tt>  
</tt></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">
From Whois: ICANN Registrar: CRONON AG BERLIN, NIEDERLASSUNG REGENSBURG
</pre><blockquote style="border-left: #5555EE solid 0.2em; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0.85em"><pre style="margin: 0em;">
    3. Your Internet service provider (ISP), who provides you with
    some sort of Internet access and/or hosting, and who also may have
    registered the domain with a registrar on your behalf, or may be
    a registrar and have registered it with the TLD registry.
</pre><tt>  
</tt></blockquote><tt>My provider are some (probably former) friends of mine with whom I used 
</tt><tt>to share a root server. They did the registration. They are so hopeless 
</tt><tt>... I better don't get into details.
</tt><blockquote style="border-left: #5555EE solid 0.2em; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0.85em"><pre style="margin: 0em;">
There may be a fourth company, another registrar, involved here too.
</pre><tt>  
</tt></blockquote><tt>Yes, between the Cronon AG and my friend's company there is the 
</tt><tt>reseller, the domain-offensive.de. So the chain is: me -&gt; my friends -&gt; 
</tt><tt>domain-offensive -&gt; Cronon AG.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><blockquote style="border-left: #5555EE solid 0.2em; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0.85em"><pre style="margin: 0em;">
If you could clarify this, and give us the names of the companies (so
that we can verify that they are what you think they are), it would help
to solve this problem.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

In the whois record is listed:
- the ICANN Registrar: Cronon AG
- Owner Contact: that is me
- Admin Contact: also me
- Technical Contact: my friends
- Zone Contact: my friends

Domain-Offensive is listed nowhere.

The problem is that you are &quot;owner&quot; in the sense of listed contact,
but you are not owner in any legal sense as far as I know; you are
merely renting the right to use the domain, and the service of having
it listed on the root DNS servers.  In fact, I would guess you were
re-re-renting it from ISP, which was re-renting it from the reseller,
which was renting it from the registrar, which appropriated it from
the dictionary according to rules established by ICANN.

You had better get legal advice.  I suspect that Germany and/or the EU
has certain regulations in place, and that is why the .de domains were
</pre><tt>treated differently.  
</tt></blockquote><tt>For the Denic &quot;the domain owner is the DENICs contractual partner and

</tt><blockquote style="border-left: #5555EE solid 0.2em; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0.85em"><pre style="margin: 0em;">
I would call the EU regulator on these matters.
</pre><tt>  
</tt></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">
How can I find out who that is?
</pre><blockquote style="border-left: #5555EE solid 0.2em; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0.85em"><pre style="margin: 0em;">
They might not be pleased that the reseller (who is presumably a
German entity?) is playing these games, just because the top-level
</pre><tt>domain is different.  
</tt></blockquote><tt>The reseller is German, like the registrar, my friends and me. Just the 
</tt><tt>TLD is not German.
</tt><blockquote style="border-left: #5555EE solid 0.2em; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0.85em"><pre style="margin: 0em;">
I am pretty sure that there is a regulation that
the affected customer (you, I mean, not the provider) be contacted.
It might very well conflict with another regulation regarding honest
dealing with the reseller's direct customer (see below); that's why we
need lawyers.
</pre><tt>  
</tt></blockquote><tt>I start to understand this conflict and the perspective of the 
</tt><tt>domain-offensive. Before I just found it ridiculous that someone not 
</tt><tt>listed publically anywhere can block the restoration of my domain and 
</tt><tt>that I have to press this information from the Cronon AG.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><blockquote style="border-left: #5555EE solid 0.2em; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0.85em"><tt> &gt; Also my problem is not only about the restoration fee. My site had quite 
</tt><tt> &gt; a nice google ranking, second place after the book on which it is based. 
</tt><tt> &gt; I have several other domains pointing on it now, but still my site 
</tt><tt> &gt; cannot be found via google (i.e. most of the time, sometimes it happens, 
</tt><tt> &gt; as I can see in the server log).
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

For that, you can sue your provider, and you'll probably win the case,
but will there be anything for him to pay you with?  If it's limited
liability company in bankruptcy, game over, you lose.  You're unlikely
to recover legal costs.  There's no way you can blame the reseller for
this; he probably *legally* is not allowed to contact you, because
that would be a threat against his actual customer, your provider.
</pre><tt>  
</tt></blockquote><tt>I am afraid there is nothing to pay me. And now that the 
</tt><tt>domain-offensive said they will contact their customers in future I am 
</tt><tt>also not so mad anymore at them. But still I think things like this are 
</tt><tt>not supposed to be legal. And there is a good reason why the Denic 
</tt><tt>handles things differently.
</tt><blockquote style="border-left: #5555EE solid 0.2em; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0.85em"><pre style="margin: 0em;">
I think the reseller
</pre><tt>is price-gouging, no matter how nice he seems; 
</tt></blockquote><tt>This was my failed attempt in indirect speech. I did not think he was 
</tt><tt>nice until the last two mails where he promised to change their handling 
</tt><tt>of end customers.
</tt><blockquote style="border-left: #5555EE solid 0.2em; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0.85em"><pre style="margin: 0em;">
you should not have to
pay an exorbitant &quot;restoration fee&quot; since you were not the customer in
arrears -- you are a new customer.  In fact, the charge for a single
domain from the reseller is probably much higher than what you were
paying, but you may be able to avoid that because the reseller
explicitly split his invoice into a &quot;restoration fee&quot; which is bogus,
and the original rental fee, which is probably way lower than he would
charge to a new customer (but that's his problem, not yours).
</pre><tt>  
</tt></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>It seems that there is a fee involved for restoring the domain, the 
</tt><tt>Cronon AG wanted 47,40 Euro. The domain-offensive.de wanted around 80. I 
</tt><tt>managed to get them down to 47,40 plus tax, that could be what they have 
</tt><tt>to pay to the Cronon AG. Not sure about the tax. The fee for the domain 
</tt><tt>is their usual fee. Still I am paying
</tt><tt>for things my friends did wrong. They owe me much more money than this 
</tt><tt>and I doubt I will ever see it again.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>So probably I will sue nobody and just have lost time, money and google 
</tt><tt>ranking and gained some insights in domain rights (shiver). But maybe I 
</tt><tt>should post this case in the internic complaint form 
</tt><tt>(<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://reports.internic.net/cgi/registrars/problem-report.cgi">http://reports.internic.net/cgi/registrars/problem-report.cgi</a>), maybe 
</tt><tt>they will correct this.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>By the way, if I understand the following part from the registrars 
</tt><tt>agreement (<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.icann.org/en/registrars/ra-agreement-17may01.htm">http://www.icann.org/en/registrars/ra-agreement-17may01.htm</a>) 
</tt><tt>correctly shouldn't the domain-offensive be listed somewhere?
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><blockquote style="border-left: #5555EE solid 0.2em; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0.85em"><tt>3.7.7.3 Any Registered Name Holder that intends to license use of a

Confused ...
