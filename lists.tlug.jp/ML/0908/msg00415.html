<pre style="margin: 0em;">
Hi all,

</pre><tt>I have a problem with my domain, which ends on &quot;net&quot;, and although I am 
</tt><tt>sitting in Germany and probably should seek legal advice here I would be 
</tt><tt>very interested in learning how the following problem would be handled 
</tt><tt>in the US or in Japan, since &quot;net&quot; is a general domain and I would not 
</tt><tt>have this problem at all if my domain would end in &quot;de&quot;.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>The short version is that my provider did not pay and that the reseller 
</tt><tt>between my provider and the registrar had my domain put on hold without 
</tt><tt>contacting me, although I am listed as the owner of the domain with 
</tt><tt>valid contact details and the existence of the reseller was not even 
</tt><tt>known to me. The domain was disabled on August 1st and is not reachable 
</tt><tt>up to today, although I have offered to pay from beginning. But I do 
</tt><tt>have hopes that in the course of the next week the registrar might 
</tt><tt>perhaps lower himself to put it back online again.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

And here is the long version:

</pre><tt>On the first of August I discovered that my website could not be reached 
</tt><tt>anymore. The server was up, it was  my domain that was put &quot;on hold 
</tt><tt>(redemption period)&quot;. Although I am listed as owner contact with valid 
</tt><tt>data I had never received any information that there was a problem with 
</tt><tt>the domain.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>I immediately called my provider and he said he would take care of it. 
</tt><tt>When I returned from my holiday on the 10th of August nothing had 
</tt><tt>happened. My Provider has some internal trouble, so I gave up on this 
</tt><tt>end (totally hopeless) and called the &quot;sponsoring registrar&quot;. They told 
</tt><tt>me that my provider had failed to pay, that it would cost 47,40 € to 
</tt><tt>restore the domain, that I should write an email to a certain address to 
</tt><tt>the effect that I would pay for the restoration and that I want the 
</tt><tt>AuthInfo for a domain transfer.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>So I did on the 10th of August. One day later I got an email with a 
</tt><tt>ticket number. Two days later I called and asked why my domain still was 
</tt><tt>not restored. They told me, that I could expect the issue to  be 
</tt><tt>resolved by the end of the week. Since I was willing to pay and not my 
</tt><tt>provider the issue had to go through accounting first, or something like 
</tt><tt>that. I was quite astonished.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>The next day (13th of August) I phoned again, saying that obviously I 
</tt><tt>had been operating on the false assumption that I was dealing with 
</tt><tt>professionals who know what it means for a website to be disconnected 
</tt><tt>for that amount of time. I said/wrote that am willing to pay, so why 
</tt><tt>this delay? Everyday offline hurts my domain. I payed all bills I 
</tt><tt>received, it is not my fault that the domain is offline, nevertheless I 
</tt><tt>was willing to pay in the assumption this issue would be resolved 
</tt><tt>quickly. If I loose my domain because they don't react I will not pay, 
</tt><tt>rather they will have to pay me.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>This did have some effect. After roughly 10 min. or more on hold the guy 
</tt><tt>on the other side told me that there was a reseller between the 
</tt><tt>registrar and my provider and that this reseller had to give the written 
</tt><tt>permission to restore my domain, I should contact him.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>So far I had not known about any reseller, he also does not appear in 
</tt><tt>the whois record. I phoned the reseller. They told me I had to become 
</tt><tt>their customer and pay 82 € for the restoration. And that the registrar 
</tt><tt>first has to ask them in writing. I told them I would not want to become 
</tt><tt>their customer and would rather agree with the registrar on the 47,40 €.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>I phoned the registrar again and asked them to solve their communication 
</tt><tt>problem with the reseller. The registrar promised to talk with the 
</tt><tt>reseller and expected the domain to be online the same day. In the 
</tt><tt>meantime is was Friday, August 21. On noon I got the first reply by the 
</tt><tt>registrar ever to my ticket: they had contacted the reseller and were 
</tt><tt>waiting for a reply. This is the last I heard from them.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>On Monday, 24th of August the domain was still not restored. On Tuesday 
</tt><tt>I called the reseller and asked him whether he had responded to the 
</tt><tt>registrars question. He said he had refused the restore on Monday 
</tt><tt>because I had refused to become a customer with them.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>In the meantime I had found out that other customers of my provider with 
</tt><tt>a &quot;de&quot; domain did not have this problem. The Denic had contacted them 
</tt><tt>about the problem and asked them to name a different provider. So simple.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>I asked the reseller why there was this problem with my net-domain and 
</tt><tt>why he could not handle it the same way as the de-domains. He was the 
</tt><tt>reseller of all these domains. Because the registrars handle it 
</tt><tt>differently, was his reply.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>We finally agreed that I would pay the restoration fee plus tax, 8,50 € 
</tt><tt>for the domain and that I would be their customer for 60 days and then 
</tt><tt>be able to transfer my domain. The whole process took another two days 
</tt><tt>because there had been some misunderstandings about the way to transfer 
</tt><tt>the money and proof the transfer. On the afternoon of Friday, August 
</tt><tt>21st I got a mail from the reseller that they had asked the registrar to 
</tt><tt>restore the domain and will keep me updated. The domain is still not 
</tt><tt>restored, but with the pace of work I have seen from the registrar I 
</tt><tt>might have to wait another week -&gt; accounting and such.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>I asked the boss of the reseller why they did not contact me in the 
</tt><tt>first place. He said he contacted my provider, I should ask him for the 
</tt><tt>money, he could not contact my providers customers. His company has been 
</tt><tt>very helpful to me inspite of me not wanting to become their customer. 
</tt><tt>My mistake was to take this provider and not their company. They had 
</tt><tt>lost so much money because of my provider and still help me.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>And what about my time and money? We would not have this problem at all 
</tt><tt>if he had contacted me. My contact information was available. I did not 
</tt><tt>know that he existed. I had no chance to find out about his existence 
</tt><tt>before I threatened the registrar with legal consequences. What is this? 
</tt><tt>Is this legal? No reply from the boss on these questions yet.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Also my problem is not only about the restoration fee. My site had quite 
</tt><tt>a nice google ranking, second place after the book on which it is based. 
</tt><tt>I have several other domains pointing on it now, but still my site 
</tt><tt>cannot be found via google (i.e. most of the time, sometimes it happens, 
</tt><tt>as I can see in the server log).
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>He says he cannot contact my provider's customers, but he can switch off 
</tt><tt>their domains? Is this legal? On the side of  the registrar?
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>I searched a bit on the internet and so far only found this proposal 
</tt><tt>from 2002: 
</tt><tt><a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.icann.org/en/registrars/redemption-proposal-14feb02.htm">http://www.icann.org/en/registrars/redemption-proposal-14feb02.htm</a>
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>I also tried to understand the registrars agreement: 
</tt><tt><a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.icann.org/en/registrars/ra-agreement-17may01.htm">http://www.icann.org/en/registrars/ra-agreement-17may01.htm</a>
</tt><tt>But I could not find or understand the relevant part. Can anyone point 
</tt><tt>me to more &quot;human readable&quot; information?
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Best regards, Uli
