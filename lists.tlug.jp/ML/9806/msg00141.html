    &gt;&gt; &gt;What is difficult with PPP ?
    &gt;&gt; 
    &gt;&gt; A great deal, on Linux and FreeBSD.  Lots of people have lots
    &gt;&gt; of difficulty getting a connection established.  That's

    Karl-Max&gt; Very funny. It takes me a few minites and up I am.....

A bird in the hand....  But how long do you stay up?

C'mon Karl, have you had too much weed already tonight, or are you
intentionally being obtuse?  Case in point...

    &gt;&gt; Linux is designed with networking through an Ethernet card in
    &gt;&gt; mind, not dial-up stuff.  The configuration software for

    Karl-Max&gt; Wrong. Linux networks just with anything that transfers
    Karl-Max&gt; data with an ease that always stuns me. You can do real
    Karl-Max&gt; networking acrobatics with it without even knowing the
    Karl-Max&gt; details. just consider IP masquerading, protocol
    Karl-Max&gt; tunneling, radio networking etc. etc. Unbelievable. With
    Karl-Max&gt; Linux you can even use shoestrings for networking (
    Karl-Max&gt; almost ).

If "you" is _you_, or "you" is _me_, or "you" is any of a couple of
dozen contributors here.  If "you" is _Eric Standlee_, then "you" is
probably wondering where he can get some of that crack cocaine
Karl-Max has been smoking ... it won't get his _net_ up, but _he'll_
be pretty high.

    &gt;&gt; use their computer they would have 90% less trouble.  But since
    &gt;&gt; we know a lot of people won't, we need to make

    Karl-Max&gt; Yes I know, because they always find a knowledgeable
    Karl-Max&gt; idiot who solves the problem for them. That's what
    Karl-Max&gt; happens in reality. I always fight that. Let them sit in
    Karl-Max&gt; the shit and rot there until they decide to move their
    Karl-Max&gt; asses themselves !

Scott is happy to hear you say that, I bet, because that's one smart
Karl-Max who is not going to put out a Linux distribution that knocks
TurboLinux back into the pack.

Of course nothing is idiot-proof except Murphy's Law.  But Bill Gates
has proved that 2 out of 3 not only isn't bad, but if you play that
hand right you can become the world's richest man.

The point is that there will always be money to be made from the
_employers_ of the asses that sit in the chairs and drink coffee until
tech support shows up.

    Karl-Max&gt; Unix/Linux: They have a huge amount of dirty looking
    Karl-Max&gt; ugly tools that almost never break and which they can
    Karl-Max&gt; combine like LEGO to make new, more powerful tools to
    Karl-Max&gt; repair practically everything.  The masters in the shop
    Karl-Max&gt; have developed this into an art and they even get that
    Karl-Max&gt; occasional Jumbo Jet that finds its way into their shop
    Karl-Max&gt; repaired with the tools they have - despite being car
    Karl-Max&gt; mechanics. Everybody wonders how they manage doing this
    Karl-Max&gt; and considers them wizards.

    Karl-Max&gt; Now which mechanics are the happier ones ?

We are, we are, we are!!

That's an argument I can relate to.  I like happy, happy, yellow,
yellow, happy.  (J-TV ObRef.)

Some people, however, work with the computer because it's their job.
And they work at their job because they won't get paid if they don't.
This sucks.  Already Karl-Ma(r)x knew it.  :-)

You don't owe them any attention---do your thing, and we'll all be
richer for it, at least a little.

But _Jonathan_ wants to make their day a little brighter (because the
screen is displaying data, instead of going into blank mode waiting
for the tech support babe to show up, you know, one of the ones who
advertise Epson printers).  Let's let him....

    &gt;&gt; The fact that NT and Windows 95 provide a lot more of this
    &gt;&gt; end-user ease of use stuff and still have a much shorter
    &gt;&gt; learning curve is a big reason (other than the clout that MS

    Karl-Max&gt; ????? I remember when they started at OberlandNet they
    Karl-Max&gt; did that under NT. They had no end of trouble and soon
    Karl-Max&gt; threw it out and switched to Linux and had much less
    Karl-Max&gt; trouble then.

Karl, are you afraid of sharp objects?  You just avoided another point
completely.  Sure, Linux is better for the techs who really run an
internet.  But that's not what Jonathan is talking about.

Go ahead and ignore the non-tech end users.  But leave us the freedom
to be their advocates if we want.  (I don't.  Let them sit and
rot... ;-)
