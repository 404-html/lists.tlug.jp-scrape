&gt; If you do find a way to make the whole setup work as envisioned, we may

Okay, I'm just getting started, but here's a progress report.

I bought a NEC Aterm IT50 DSU (an ISDN TA) last night at Yodobashi
Camera in Shinjuku for JPY26,000.  It has 2 analog and 1 serial port,
lots of features, including PIAFS, but no PHS receiver.  It is
configurable via the serial port with an AT command set, including
many extensions that seem to control every feature.

NTT installed my ISDN line this morning.  The Aterm's default
configuration worked for the analog (one number) right off the bat.
I didn't even have to set the phone number.  The digital part
took some time to get configured for TWICS.  I tried Craig's setup
for the IW60, but it didn't work for me.  My box has had a lot of
ISPs, so this is *not* the most elegant configuration, but:

the uncommented lines in /etc/named.boot:
forwarders 192.135.222.9 192.135.222.10
slave

/etc/ppp/options:
crtscts modem /dev/cua1 115200 connect /etc/ppp/twics user jdb
asyncmap 0 lock mru 1542 passive -mn -vj lcp-echo-interval 30
lcp-echo-failure 4 ipcp-accept-remote defaultroute

/etc/ppp/pap-secrets:
jdb * [my password]

/etc/ppp/twics:
#!/bin/sh
#
chat -v TIMEOUT 5 "" \
	'\KAT' OK-AT-OK \
	'AT&amp;K3Q0V1X3' "OK" \
	'AT$N1=1' "OK" ATD53617270 "CONNECT 64000"

Getting the modem to start talking to chat was the hardest thing.
The modem configuration isn't really a bootstrap, of course,
since it assumes that the modem is already using hardware flow control
and returning verbal result codes.  Incidentally, $N1=0 did not work
for me; it would connect for a few seconds, but then disconnect.

Next, I'll try to configure my ppp to dial on demand.

I'll also be upgrading the NEC's firmware this weekend.  There's a 
few interesting new features.  I can't read very well, so this will
require more investigation, but as far as I can tell, it will be able
to do "pseudo call forwarding" by using the second channel to initiate
its own call to the number you configure.  They contrast this with
call forwarding via NTT's "flexphone" service, which would use the
D channel to re-route the original call rather than rack up new charges
and tie up both B channels.  I think the D channel way was NEC's
original intent, but perhaps the pseudo way will let me ring the local
line, forward to a PHS, and eventually have vgetty answer the local line
to do voicemail.  The manual seems to have configurations for forwarding
and original numbers and whether or not each line exists (the forwarding
and the original).  (Katakana to-ki means phone line?)

I think that it will also add pseudo three-way calling, which
I haven't read about, but am guessing means that a third number
is called via the second B channel and connected to both the local
active analog port and the first B channel.  This might also
let me do my PHS thing, if it can initiate the call out the 2nd
channel before the local port answers, and connects the first one
to answer with the incoming channel.  Or, even if the local port
must answer, the voice mail could announce that it's trying to
forward the call to my PHS and then initiate 3-way calling.  Oooh,
it could even give the caller the choice of trying my mobile or
just leaving a message.

If anyone has more info on this new stuff (www.mesh.ne.jp/aterm/)
please let me know.  Also, does anyone know if I can register a
PHS number as one of the two telehoudai numbers (for unlimited calling
late at night)?  Then pseudo call forwarding would be cheaper.
Plus, if I can get this call forwarding thing working, then I can
make international call-back calls from my PHS.  Shoot, I could
even make free local calls the same way, if I throw in some kind of
caller ID thing.  Is it cheaper to call from a home to a PHS than
vice versa?  Also, is calling to a PHS more expensive than a local call?

Well, I've gotta goto bed now.  I'm getting too excited..
