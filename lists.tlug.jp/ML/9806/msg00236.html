Hi,
inally I managed to configure Linux so that I could use the
Budapest number - which happens to be Compuserve.

At Budapest access point normal compuserve login script can not be
used, PAP authentication is used and a little modification is needed
to avoid the 7-bit problem:

===========================================================================
A Redhat Linux user should do the following:
In Control Panel -&gt; Network Configurator -&gt; add ppp interface (ppp1)
-------------------------------------------------------------
Phone: 06,12919999                    Budapest number from countryside
Check: Use PAP authentication
PPP Login: username@example.com
PPP Password: your-password

&lt;DONE&gt; -- save it.

vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/chat-ppp1

modify last line from
            'CONNECT' ''
to
            'CONNECT'
(If you give a reply the Compuserve end goes 7-bit....)

===========================================================================

That's all you can: ifup ppp1

Thanks to all,
gaspar

&gt; &gt; it works, but it seems to work only with Windows95 which is totally
&gt; You probably talk about that proprietary stuff Compuserve provides...
&gt; &gt; useless for me, because all my mail stuff is on the Linux partition
&gt; &gt; of a dual-boot laptop. 
&gt; &gt; I would be glad if somebody with compuserve experience could help me. I
&gt; No problem. I'll teach you the ropes in the following.....
&gt; &gt; Compuserve allience I am thinking of attaching a serial port analyzer, if
&gt; No problem. Just come along and grab my HP1640A.....
&gt; &gt; What I have learnt so far is that:
&gt; &gt; o the access point is Compuserve
&gt; &gt; o When you connect it is 7-bit mode.
&gt; &gt; o People with compuserve accounts here converse the following way:
&gt; &gt; CONNECT 
&gt; &gt; &lt;garbage&gt;: +                           this swithes from 7 to 8 bit mode
&gt; &gt; Host Name:  CIS
&gt; &gt; Login ID: 12345,213/GO:PPPCONNECT      This tells them what we are up to
&gt; &gt;                                        but it wont work for me. It says
&gt; &gt;                                        'invalid login' . Yeah, my login
&gt; &gt;                                        is not a number.....
&gt; &gt; Password: &lt;passw&gt;
&gt; &gt; start pppd here.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; So this works for Compuserve users in Linux, but it wont work for me. 
&gt; &gt; My Id is not a number. But in windows it works. How can I get what windows
&gt; &gt; does without a serial analyzer? 
&gt; It works with Linux, too. Except if you are in Japan. In Japan
&gt; for some political reasons they only provide full services if
&gt; you don't use their direct access point, but only if you come
&gt; via the "FENICS" network or if you are a subscriber with NIFTY -
&gt; in which case you can use their access points.
&gt; 
&gt; Compuserve provides a listing of access point phone numbers
&gt; somewhere (I actually forgot where - browse around). Here is
&gt; already catc #1: the fast majority of fast access points given
&gt; there are actually NIFTY access points - if you aren't a
&gt; subscriber, you can't use them. All the low speed access points
&gt; ( 2400 bit/s !!!!! - welcome to the stone age ! ) are FENICS.
&gt; FENICS has high speed access points as well, but the trick is to
&gt; get information about their phone numbers. Despite weeks of
&gt; arguments Compuserve customer service was only able to provide
&gt; me with dial in numbers in Osaka and Tokyo. I later found out
&gt; that it isn't the fault of Compuserve, but that of FENICS - I
&gt; found their homepage and an email address and I asked them for a
&gt; list, but they didn't even bother to reply. Apparently they
&gt; don't bother to talk to somebody as lowly as me - or Compuserve.
&gt; 
&gt; In the following I provide the login script I use for Minicom in
&gt; Japan.
&gt; 
&gt; sleep 4
&gt; send "@example.com"
&gt; expect {
&gt;   "HOST NAME"
&gt;   }
&gt; sleep 1
&gt; send "C CIS"
&gt; expect {
&gt;   "User ID:"
&gt;   }
&gt; send "$(LOGIN)"
&gt; expect {
&gt;   "Password:"
&gt;   }
&gt; send "$(PASS)"
&gt; 
&gt; After you got a connection, you first wait 4 seconds. This is
&gt; important, because the network isn't exactly very fast. Then you
&gt; send the string @example.com ( terminated with CRLF as usual - in the
&gt; script this is done by default ). Then you wait for the string
&gt; HOST NAME. Then wait a second. Then you send a C CIS ( means
&gt; "connect Compuserve", of course ). Then you wait for Compuserve
&gt; to come back with the well known "User ID" prompt. You then send
&gt; a &lt;your-CIS-ID&gt;/GO:PPPCONNECT, wait for the "Password" prompt
&gt; and send your password. After that you quit Minicom with the
&gt; infamous CTRL-A Q and launch your pppd ( see section "terminal
&gt; authentication" in PPP for dummies which I posted lately ).
&gt; 
&gt; Strictly speaking, that @example.com stuff is only required for the slow
&gt; access points, for the fast one you can just leave it away. On
&gt; the other hand, it doesn't do any harm with the fast ones -
&gt; except that it generates a "Unknown command" response - then
&gt; everything proceeds normally.
&gt; 
&gt; It should be understood that such a connection is VERY FLAKY
&gt; !!!! If you keep being kicked out all the time, decrease the
&gt; speed with which you talk to your modem. I found out that 9600
&gt; bit/s provide a halfways albeit very slow connection. I tried to
&gt; track down where the problems come from and did a ping to my
&gt; provider at home. I got any amount of duplicated packets, often
&gt; quite far ( in time ) apart. Well, that explains it: if the DUP
&gt; falls within the next receive window of TCP/IP it's gonna mess
&gt; up things there with an ensuing death of pppd.....
&gt; 
&gt; This DUP stuff is a most alarming fact: it is downright
&gt; pathological and normally unheard of in any decent network 
&gt; ( I am certainly not a newbie in networking, but I have NEVER
&gt; seen it in such an amount anywhere else ).
&gt; 
&gt; Again, I strongly suspect that FENICS is to blame because I've
&gt; never seen such things happen with Compuserve outside Japan
&gt; (althogh I am not very happy with their networking....).
&gt; 
&gt; Important catch: outside Japan you have to use terminal settings
&gt; of "7E1" to log into Compuserve. DON'T DO THAT OVER FENICS!!!!
&gt; ALWAYS USE SETTINGS OF "8N1" !!!!! If you fail to do so, you get
&gt; nowhere.....I learned this the hard way by wasting an hour and
&gt; quite a couple of Yens inside a hot telephone booth playing with
&gt; the parameters under Minicom.....
&gt; 
&gt; Here are some decent dial in points into FENICS:
&gt; 
&gt; Tokyo: 57105300
&gt; Osaka: 9443620
&gt; Okayama: 0862214956
&gt; Fukui: 675900
&gt; 
&gt; The one Compuserve lists for Niigata ( with 14400 bits/s ) is OK.
&gt; Don't be astonished if accessing from Japan makes your
&gt; Compuserve bill go through the ceiling: FENICS is expensive.
&gt; 
&gt; This should be enough to get you into Compuserve in Japan....
&gt; 
&gt; Now about Compuserve outside Japan.
&gt; 
&gt; My script to connect to Compuserve outside Japan is as follows:
&gt; 
&gt; send "\r"
&gt; expect {
&gt;    "Host Name:"
&gt;    }
&gt; send "CIS"
&gt; expect {
&gt;    "User ID:"
&gt;    }
&gt; send "$(LOGIN)/GO:PPPCONNECT"
&gt; expect {
&gt;    "Password:"
&gt;    }
&gt; send "$(PASS)"
&gt; 
&gt; It is much like the previous one, Just with the FENICS stuff
&gt; left out. And here is that important SUPER CATCH:
&gt; 
&gt; Outside Japan you always log into Compuserve using a terminal
&gt; setting of "7E1". You have that until PPP starts. PPP can only
&gt; work with an 8bit clean connection. So inside Minicom you have
&gt; to stick to it, but when you leave it and start up pppd locally,
&gt; it talks to Compuserve's pppd with 8N1 !!!! This is in stark
&gt; contrast to what I said in "PPP for dummies". If you don't know
&gt; it, you're hosed.....
&gt; 
&gt; Another catch: With a normal provider, if you kill your local
&gt; pppd, the modem connection is terminated. This doesn't work with
&gt; Compuserve. You have to power cycle your modem.
&gt; 
&gt; With a PCMCIA modem this is easy: you just stop the PCMCIA
&gt; services which ensues in turning off the power to your modem
&gt; card. Without power, the modem is unable to hold the connection,
&gt; of course. A bit brutal, but works well.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd generally dissuade to start PCMCIA during bootup: PCMCIA
&gt; devices tend to be power hungry ( particularly modems ) and with
&gt; no cardmgr running, they are powered down. I just start cardmgr
&gt; by hand when needed. This way I can leave my modem plugged in
&gt; without bothering about the power drain.
&gt; 
&gt; Alternatives to Compuserve: talk with your provider and ask them
&gt; whether they are members of one of the global reach alliances
&gt; like GRIC or IPASS. If so, have them instruct you how to log
&gt; into another provider close to your respective location
&gt; belonging to the same alliance. You then can login just into
&gt; another provider closeby and he authenticates you via your home
&gt; provider and bills him for the services provided to you. Your
&gt; provider in turn bills you for that. Twics, for example is a
&gt; member of GRIC.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope that gets you started.
