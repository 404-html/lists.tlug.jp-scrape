Hi,
since we have gotten quite a few new members recently, I would
like to remind everyone that the TLUG mailing list is available in
digest format. The digest is published once a day or when a maximum
number of characters has been reached.  To subscribe to the digest,
send e-mail to 

  majordomo@example.com 

and include
  
  subscribe tlug-digest
  end

in the body of the message.

To unsubscribe to the tlug mailing list, 

  unsubscribe tlug
  end

Both the digest and the mailing list are archived since the
beginning of the lists.  Send e-mail to majordomo@example.com
and include

  help
  end

in the body of the message to get information on the commands available.

Raffle
******   
I have received an inquiry about purchasing raffle tickets without
attending the meeting.  I would like to get comments.  Also, should
one person be allowed to purchase more than one ticket?

---------------------

Committees and Projects
***********************
The last bit of administrative detail is that I would like to
bring up the topic of the creation of committees and projects.

I think that the committee leader should have a voting position
on things like allocation of group finances, creation of policy
on stuff like stance on copyrights.  

The idea I have at the moment is to allocate 15 minutes of the
Dec. 13th meeting to let members join a committee.  For 
example, we might have a nomikai in January and the members
might want to give some input to the person organizing the
nomikai.  I imagine that the committee meetings should be
held concurrently, be brief, get volunteers, and handle planning
by e-mail if necessary.   I've nominated a few people for
some committees.  Feel free to discuss this process, the
idea of creating committees in general, and anything else 
right on this list. 

We should also allocate some time to soliciting volunteers for
projects.  The projects are short term and may or may not
be partially financed by TLUG.  At this moment, TLUG has
almost no finances.  :-)
