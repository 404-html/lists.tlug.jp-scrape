Hi,
an announcement for the Dec. meeting is shown below.  Please
distribute this announcement to as wide an audience (of
potential Linux users) as possible.  I've done a post
to fj.os.linux and will send a fax to Linc Media, publishers
of Computing Japan.  Can someone do a post to Tokyo PC?

There is a whole bunch of Linux related mailing lists at
<A TARGET="_top" HREF="http://www.linux.or.jp/ml_list.html">http://www.linux.or.jp/ml_list.html</A>.

Perhaps this notice might be appropriate for some of the
lists.  I did a post to debian-jp last time, but I'm don't
subscribe to the list anymore.


Regards,
Craig

		       TLUG December 13 Meeting
		       ------------------------

All Linux lovers in the Kanto area are invited to attend
the December 13th Tokyo Linux Users Group meeting.  Membership
is open to anyone.  There are currently no membership dues.

TLUG is a non-profit, non-political organization established 
in June of 1994 to exchange information on the use of Linux 
and Free Software Foundation tools.  TLUG has an active
mailing list, home page, and regular physical meetings.  
Discussions are primarily held in English.  However, 
everyone is welcome to attend.  We especially want to encourage
Japanese people to attend and will make efforts to 
support a bilingual meeting.  

The TLUG home page is available at
	<A TARGET="_top" HREF="http://www.twics.com/~tlug/">http://www.twics.com/~tlug/</A>

Notes of the last meeting, including pictures of some
of the members are available at

Meeting Place:   HSBC James Capel Securities 5F

-------

TLUG meetings are traditionally small and unstructured 
(VERY CASUAL).  Most of the benefit of the meeting comes 
from chatting with other Linux users and having informal 
discussions.  Lunch is one of the main reasons for going 
to the meetings for many people.  Everyone is expected 
to pay for their own meal.

We will be meeting at Tokyo station on December 13 , Saturday
in front of the Tokyo station Yaesu central exit at 12:30.
There is more than one Yaesu exit, so be careful.  If you
know you are going and don't know what we look like, send
me an e-mail (craig@example.com) and I'll make sure we wait 
for you.  After everyone gathers, we'll walk down the stairs 
and have lunch in the restaurant area in the basement of 
Tokyo station.  We usually decide where to eat when everyone gathers.  
If you're late or can't find us, your second chance is
to hang out at Starbucks at 13:30.  After a cup of coffee
we'll walk over to Joe Marchak's office.  

At least the following hardware will be set up for demonstration.
    Sparc 2     "Sparky" Linux RedHat installed
    PPro 200    (the CDE machine) with Red Hat installed
    Pentium 100 "Deb-chan" with Debian installed (probably)
    Hub&amp;cables  

We may do a few installs.  Feel free to bring your own machine
or software.  People often bring their hard disks for an
install.  The meeting is usually unstructured.  

We have the following prizes that will be given out to
members that purchase a 500 yen raffle ticket. 

&gt;From John  "Mr. Santa" Little's company

	3 x SPARCstation IPC with 12MB memory, 207MB disk and
	    colour frame-buffer, loaded with Red Hat 4.2. (Note, no
	    keyboard, mouse or monitor available, but these units
	    are still fully functional network workstations and
	    can be used with vt100 terminals on the serial ports).

	2 x SPARCstation IPC. No memory, no disk, built-in 
	    monochrome frame-buffer 
		 
	1 x Apple LaserWriter II (as is). I believe that this 
	    printer is fully functional, but it comes with a spare
	    motherboard, just in case. This is a PostScript printer
	    with a built-in SCSI, RS232 and Appletalk connectors.

	1 x Epson wide-carriage dot-matrix (impact) printer. Believed
	    to be in functional condition. Would be of interest to
	    anyone wanting to produce draft copy in Japanese.

	3 x Sun SpeakerBox. These external speakers are intended for 
	    use with SPARCstation 10 and Classic models (not IPCs).

	+   Various floppy drives, cables and attachments for Sun
	    machines (grab-bag odds'n'ends).


   Obviously, everything is (well) used. Nothing is guaranteed. :-)


Also, we have several Open Linux Lite Caldera CDs

If you are coming to the meeting, join the mailing
list by sending e-mail to majordomo@example.com and
including

what the group is like.
