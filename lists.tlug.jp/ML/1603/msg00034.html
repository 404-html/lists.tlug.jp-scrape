<pre>Hi,

Many years ago, I used to use to directly search (using grep) the EIJIRO text file. 
I was looking for the most useful Japanese to English suggestions and thought this was the best (at the time, at least :-))

<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.japaneselanguagetools.com/docs/Eijiro.html">http://www.japaneselanguagetools.com/docs/Eijiro.html</a>

An old version appears to be still on sale. (The site says they don't
plan to sell any of their later versions, unless enrypted for their
product)

&gt; I have been contemplating the following &quot;question&quot; for a long time, 
&gt; since every time I dare asking something like that, I am stoned to death 
&gt; or burnt at the stake within 7 seconds of posting.
&gt; In a recent response to my (apparently stupid) question about HDD 
&gt; problems, Mr. Turnbull used the term &quot;technopeasant&quot; (a new term?).
&gt; That is exactly what I am.
&gt; And according to the person who wrote the article cited also by Mr. 
&gt; Turnbull <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://linuxmafia.com/~rick/faq/crybaby.html#allowed">http://linuxmafia.com/~rick/faq/crybaby.html#allowed</a>
&gt; *I SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED to use a computer .. at all!*. I should be 
&gt; using pencil (I prefer fountain pen!) and paper.
&gt; 
&gt; With this in mind, my little problem.
&gt; I am working as an acupuncturist - fortunately I do not need a computer 
&gt; for that - and as a translator.
&gt; As a translator I DO(!) need a (at least 2) computer AND .. here comes 
&gt; the problem .. a lot of dictionaries.
&gt; About 8 years ago I came across something called &quot;Linux for translators&quot; 
&gt; and was happy of finally having found something NOT Microsoft!
&gt; Since then I have spent hundreds (maybe thousands of hours) trying to 
&gt; figure out how to make Linux work,
&gt; used multiple computers (even bought one for practice purpose) and the 
&gt; stack of Live-CDs of the various flavors and versions reaches to the moon.
&gt; Unfortunately, I have not had much success so far. (Another proof of my 
&gt; stupidity?)
&gt; 
&gt; By now I can install the OS, use LibreOffice, Firefox, Thunderbird etc. 
&gt; under Linux .. so far so good.
&gt; Dictionaries???
&gt; I have been trying to find dictionaries for Linux. Very little luck.
&gt; And what there is, is mostly not acceptable, like &quot;gjiten&quot;, &quot;gwaei&quot; etc. 
&gt; I would NEVER walk into a bookstore and spend money on those, if they 
&gt; were printed on paper.
&gt; Stardict, you say. I have had a look at those too. There you may get 
&gt; (for example) in an English-French dictionary &quot;house&quot; -&gt; &quot;maison&quot; = ONE 
&gt; word + plus a vast white desert on the screen. THAT is not acceptable 
&gt; either.
&gt; Or dictionaries used under Stardict (or the &quot;successor&quot; GoldenDict) like 
&gt; &quot;Meikyo&quot; (a standard Japanese monolingual dictionary) or THE standard 
&gt; German dictionary &quot;Duden&quot;* appear as VERY cheap and largely incomplete 
&gt; (therefore useless) copies of the real things.
&gt; (* By chance I found, that on one of my disks with my various Duden 
&gt; dictionaries there IS a Linux version! Hallejuja)
&gt; Well, as far as I know &quot;Stardict&quot; was a Chinese product. Apparently a 
&gt; pirated product. And the Russians (GoldenDict) are not much better.
&gt; If you want to use Britannica etc. under Linux, then you have to be real 
&gt; computer wizard to do the required compiling and sudo wizardry with 
&gt; hundred of commands. Obviously well beyond the capabilities of a 
&gt; technopeasant (me).
&gt; And there is a very long list of other &quot;dictionaries&quot; I tried. None of 
&gt; them is &quot;up to the job&quot; for professional (translation) purposes.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, try running Windows dictionaries under Linux. I have been spending 
&gt; years on this little tasks.
&gt; VirtualBox? I was not able to make that work.
&gt; Wine? Does not work at all. I tried for years. Trying Crossover 
&gt; (commercial!) did not help either. The technical support there told me: 
&gt; &quot;If it does not work, just forget about it.&quot; The advice of the 
&gt; professionals.
&gt; VMPlayer. That is the one I am currently &quot;using&quot;. I managed to install 
&gt; Windowx XP (Windowx 7 failed (naturally?), because of those nasty 
&gt; licence tricks of Microsoft.
&gt; However, running my (some commercial, some free) Windows dictionaries in 
&gt; VMPlayer is very far from being a comfortable working environment.
&gt; KVM? I stumbled over that idea in my desparate attemps at finding 
&gt; solutions to my &quot;problem&quot;.
&gt; Unfortunately, currently my machines are technically not advanced enough.
&gt; (I am afraid I do not have the money to buy me a high-spec supercomputer 
&gt; for that purpose.)
&gt; 
&gt; So, after all this rambling and complaining ...
&gt; ARE there any &quot;acceptable&quot; dictionaries for Linux.
&gt; With acceptable I mean: I would walk into a bookstore and NOT hesitate 
&gt; to spend money on buying a printed copy.
&gt; (Note: before the internet age I bought + collected MANY (printed) 
&gt; dictionaries. I have literally hundreds of them at home ...)
&gt; 
&gt; Or if not. Is there any other way of using my Windows dictionary 
&gt; software under Linux then the ones listed above?
&gt; Or should I &quot;just forget about using Linux&quot; (like the advice from the 
&gt; Crossover team) when it comes to translation, because it is &quot;not up to 
&gt; the job&quot;?
&gt; 
&gt; Over the last 8 years, in ALL communities, mailing lists I have joined 
&gt; over the years, hinting at THAT possibilty always meant death sentence.
&gt; The Linux community does not speak to technopeasants. The rustics should 
&gt; not be allowed to use computers,
&gt; waste the time of real computer users and go back to using pen and paper.
&gt; (If all the people working in the public sector (gas, electricity, 
&gt; banks, government, etc.) would do that ... none of the enlighted Linux 
&gt; users would be able to live=survive.)
&gt; 
&gt; *BUT .. I DO NOT WANT TO START A HOLY WAR*. The pros and cons of 
&gt; Linux/Windows/Mac etc.
&gt; I AM(!!) planing to replace the Windows XP machine in my clinic with a 
&gt; Linux Mint machine.
&gt; All I want to know is whether this plan is a big mistake or not. (again, 
&gt; probably a very stupid question).
&gt; If Linux really has nothing useful to offer for my &quot;dictionary problem&quot;, 
&gt; I maybe be forced to use Windows after all.
&gt; Something I would really like to avoid ...
&gt; 
&gt; Bracing for impact
