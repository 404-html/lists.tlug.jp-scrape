In one epistle, Ted writes:

   &gt; BTW, See my previous message to George.  I do not believe these are
   &gt; problems related to Microsoft, or to SCSI, as you imply.

SCSI?  I simply said it might be querying the SCSI interface for
"what is this disk" rather than reading the partition table.

Ah, Microsoft, now.  Microsoft is a problem only because they are
so big that the whole market follows them whether what they do
makes sense or not.  Microsoft is a problem because they can and
do assume that you will bend to them, not vice versa.

When I boot my Linux system, and type fdisk, it says "Hmmm... this
disk is over the 1024 cylinder limit, you could have problems."
When I asked Microsoft about NT trashing my hard drive, they said,
"oh, yeah, we added some hardware optimizations for the BusLogic
that the AMI FastDisk doesn't implement [because they're
proprietary; BusLogic does *not* tell AMI, but MS has the
spec...].  So sorry, but you should not use hardware that pretends
to be something else.  Not our fault."  But you know what?  The
AMI does *not* claim to be a BusLogic, it says "I am an AMI
FastDisk" and if you ask about Buslogic it says "I respond to the
published firmware protocols".  (This is the root of my current
headache with the PCI ethernet card; that driver *does* check the
vendor ID.  Disabling a vendor check is a risky business that the
*user* should specify, not the OS.)  *Operating systems should not
use undocumented interfaces they do not implement themselves.*

But in Microsoft's case, *you* should not use hardware that attempts 
to be compatible with other hardware if there's a possibility that 
compatibility is not 100%, because MS drivers *do* use that
proprietary information, and MS does not tell you so.  That
wouldn't be "transparent"!  Linux has the same problem with the
BusLogic driver---but *you* choose whether to configure it or not, 
*you* can look at the source where it says that "this driver
is known to be compatible with some revisions of the AMI FastDisk
firmware, but I don't have access to the card myself," and if an
old revision of the driver works, but a new one does not, *you*
can substitute the old driver.  On the fly with /sbin/insmod, if
you're lucky.

Another case: all known Microsoft DPMI implementations, including
NT, apparently allow any program access to the entire 4GB address
space by requesting any legal address plus a 4GB size, which wraps
around to give you everything.  This is apparently for the
convenience of driver writers (otherwise they would be need to be
loaded into ring 0 with the kernel).  The only known (as of March
1995) implementation of DPMI by any vendor that didn't support
that trick was ... ta da! ... Linux DOSemu (and maybe WinE, at
that time WinE wasn't considered worth looking at by the people
who figured out the trick).

Microsoft has the power to prevent these abuses.  Instead, they
connive at them.  Whether the efficiency gain (a lot, in the case
of the DPMI security hole) is important enough or not depends on
whether you just lost a few hundred MB of data to one of those
holes....

An abuse that MS can't prevent is Ted's line length.  82
columns....  All those damn Windowze mailers do that.  I've seen
96 character lines!  That's against the rules, I forget which RFC.
(It's actually the one that relates to Usenet, but the point is to
allow space for quoting without reformatting, which surely applies
to mail.  Especially when the author's as provocative as Ted!)

Here the point is that you can't expect the user who expects
"transparency" to go looking up the RFCs (and the Netiquette FAQ),
and then deciding whether it applies to their email before
reconfiguring!  So MS should encourage the program writers to take
that responsibility.  But they don't, and they don't respond
kindly to criticism about that (at least they didn't ca. 1994
according to news.admin.misc, I don't know about since).

So, yes, I do think that these are MS-related problems.  I don't
know if things would be better without MS, of course.  Without MS
there might very well not be as much standardization as there is.

And here's Ted again:

   &gt;   I just wanted to clear up some errors in your posting:

Kochira koso.  ;-)

   &gt; 1. The DLL's used in printing from Windows are transparent to me.
   &gt; I can use tools to see them in action, but by default they are not
   &gt; visible.

Where's my error?  Ghostscript doesn't have to be visible to you
either.  I don't see that "by default" is relevant to "transparent".
You didn't respond to my Mule + LaTeX + dvips + lpr example.  I
see a line about dvips in Mule's echo area, it's true, but I find
that a much less officious way of seeing what options are enabled
than Windows' pop-up "OK" dialogs.  Liking it is a matter of
preference, but I don't see one as more transparent than the
other.  Do you?

   &gt; 2. "transparent" and "plug-n-play" are not synonymous.

That was *my* point.  As far as I can tell, you want to (at worst)
select a model name from a menu dialog (pseudo-PNP), (at best)
have the OS query the hardware and never ask you what's attached
(true PNP).  A script that you write and debug once, add to the
appropriate hooks in all your software (and this isn't that hard,
since essentially all Unix software knows how to pipe to lpr, and
you can configure lpr to prefilter the input), and never see the
script unless you do a "ps x" *is* transparent.  Even if it took
you 365 man-days to write the script.  :-)

   &gt; 4. Microsoft - compatible hardware?  What's this?  Do you mean Plug
   &gt; n' Play?  This was not just a Microsoft sponsored project.  Should
   &gt; I also avoid Intel x86 compatible software?  Jee, then I'd have to
   &gt; wait for the Mac version of Linux...

No, I mean hardware that supplies a DOS or WindowsXX driver.  What
was the last hardware you bought that supplied a Linux driver on a 
floppy?  You got your driver from SunSite, didn't you?

   &gt; 5. If you bought a printer that is not in Microsoft's list of
   &gt; supported printers, nor has one available, you must have looked
   &gt; hard and far.  This has nothing to do with "Plug n' Play' at least
   &gt; as far as the PnP specs. go.  What printer is it?  Too embarrassed
   &gt; to admit it?

Epson Esper 1600 or something like that.  Microsoft doesn't
"support" printers, last I heard.  In most cases, Microsoft writes
a spec for drivers, the hardware vendor writes the driver.  Some
do it well, some don't.  The printer flies under DOS, but the
print | Windowze | Netware | Esper pipeline has a big problem
somewhere.  None of the vendors will take responsibility for it.
Since all of the relevant code is proprietary, *I* can't tell.
That's not transparent, that's opaque.  (In an orthogonal
dimension, of course.)

   &gt; 6. Many long time (20+ year) unix veterans have transitioned to the
   &gt; MS-office friendly environment.  You're typing to one of them now.

So?  As I pointed out, I don't work in an office environment.  I
(a) do mathematical research, producing reports whose formats are
poorly supported by MS Office, and (b) supply system services
(such as mailing lists, email account, and Web pages) to a small
group of users.  My report and correspondence system is quite
transparent to me.  My sysadmin activities are another story ... 
but that's a hobby.  And I make them more transparent every day.

If your interaction with a given system is primarily paper-
shuffling, MS Office provides a nice set of tools for shuffling
papers electronically.  (Although RCS doesn't like them much;
version control is essentially "backup often".)  Once you get
outside of what MS Office will do for you, things rapidly get
complicated and expensive in my experience.  I try Windows every
couple of years, and so far have always found that my needs aren't
met as well as they are by Unix-like systems, and Windows is not
as customizable.

Prototyping and custom tool-building are not what WindowsXX is
good at, at least not unless you can afford expensive program
development packages.  Hell, are there any good scripting
languages available for the *Windows* environment?  Tk/TCL?  (Does
"Visual Basic" count?)  Perl works in a DOS box, except that you
can't do any of the neat stuff like TCP/IP and IPC.

The bottom line is that

    If MS has already incorporated it in Windows or another of
    its products, you can do it transparently with a minimum of
    setup.  If it's not already on sale, doing it transparently
    requires expensive tools and/or a high order of programming
    sophistication.

    Whatever it is you want to do in Linux, if you want it to be
    transparent, it's going to take some effort on your part---
    but the distinction between a "pain-in-the-ass that takes
    ten minutes to edit a config file (most of that just
    *finding* the damned config file ;-)" and "rewriting the X
    windows system" is gradual, although the difference in
    extremes is just as great as in Windows.

It does require a fair amount of sophistication to customize your
Linux tools to the point of transparency.  But it does get easier,
and the experience is transferable to other tasks, including
Windows: the standard MS ToolBar now looks like a 747 cockpit, and
a lot of hardened Windows users ask *me* to help them customize
their environments.  (Even though I haven't used Windows for
anything except Minesweeper, FreeCell, and Netscape in a year.)

   &gt; Grow up you little whippersnapper &lt;g&gt;

Whatever that means.  "It's amazing how often what is called
'maturity' so closely resembles simple fatigue." &lt;g&gt;  That's
somewhere in *Time Enough for Love*, I think.

Transparency of the day:
If you occasionally mount a live file system from your CD-ROM to /cdrom, eg:
$ PATH=$PATH:`echo $PATH | sed -e "s/\/usr/\/cdrom\/usr/g"`
If you always do it, just follow that with 'echo "!!" &gt;&gt; .profile'.
Try that in Windows!
