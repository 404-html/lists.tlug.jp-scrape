 &gt; Paul Graham defines a Disagreement Hierarchy, which can help both
 &gt; readers and writers identify intellectual dishonesty and keep
 &gt; disagreements from degrading into flame wars. Here's his definition of
 &gt; &quot;DH4. Counterargument.&quot;, which is the lowest level TLUG posters should
 &gt; ever use:

I have to disagree.  Let me give a few examples.

One of my high school teachers once wrote &quot;Stephen is one of the most
pompous writers I have ever seen.&quot;  He was correct (it was a habit;
although I broke the habit, now I do it deliberately to annoy people
who call me &quot;Professor&quot; in anger -- that doesn't include you, Scott).

Ad hominem arguments are often useful, even though they are a fallacy.
There really isn't any point in contradicting or attempting to refute
what I say about elementary microeconomics, including the elementary
microeconomics of the software industry.  The arguments are by now
logically airtight.  The only interesting things to say are &quot;he's an
economics professor trained at a top 10 department&quot; and &quot;he's a known
liar&quot;.  Any attempt to deal with the content is going to put everybody
else on the list way out of their depth.

Actually, there's a third interesting thing to say, which is &quot;He's
being a jerk.&quot;  This is especially important when the person is
capable of not being a jerk (ie, its not a DH0 argument), and isn't
aware that they *are* being one.  Speaking for myself, when I'm being
a jerk it's like the old story about the mule and the 2x4: &quot;oh, that
doesn't *hurt* him, but anything smaller won't get his attention!&quot;

And a fourth: &quot;That can't be right.&quot;  More often than I'd like to
admit, that is true. :-)  Again, you need to get my attention.  And
I'm not the only one ....

So there you are.  Uses for all of DH0--DH3.  At least if you're
dealing with me. :-)

One thing that I think that Graham misses completely in his essay is
that often, perhaps even most of the time, DH4, DH5, and DH6 simply
are not available.  There's a disagreement about *values*, which are
essentially postulates.  So there needs to be a whole different way to
disagree, including &quot;agreeing to disagree&quot;, which has to do with
identifying value differences in a way that doesn't demonize (or
daemonize, which is one typical source of a prolonged flamewar) folks
with differing values.

A big problem here, though, is that a lot of people really would
rather not examine their values because they involve conflicts.  And
that's the kind of situation where &quot;u r a fag&quot; becomes useful, because
it requires no thought about one's own issues. ;-)

Regards,
