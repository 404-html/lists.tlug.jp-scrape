<tt>Computers tend to be thought of as electronic devices, and that they 
</tt><tt>are, but there is still a fair bit of mechanics to them.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Printer.  I'm on printer number three (not counting a fourth printer 
</tt><tt>(color ink-jet) that is used once a year for New Year's cards) and this 
</tt><tt>third printer is experiencing the same problem that took down printers 
</tt><tt>one and two - namely nearly always grabbing a handful of paper instead 
</tt><tt>of just one page and then jamming.  The first printer (an HP) was an 
</tt><tt>ink-jet printer, so I was happy to upgrade to a B&amp;W laser printer (also 
</tt><tt>HP) - well... happy to upgrade, but not very happy about having to do so 
</tt><tt>only one year after buying the first machine.  Anyway, the second 
</tt><tt>machine had the paper feed arranged at an angle, with gravity helping to 
</tt><tt>push the paper into the machine, so when it started grabbing bunches of 
</tt><tt>paper, I figured it was at least partly due to the gravity aspect, but 
</tt><tt>now that my latest B&amp;W laser printer (an Epson this time) is doing the 
</tt><tt>same thing with it's purely horizontal paper feed, I'm looking for some 
</tt><tt>other cause.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>One interesting side note about the HP laser printer is that the first 
</tt><tt>toner cartridge I changed was interesting to break apart (shortly before 
</tt><tt>the machine went bad) to see how it was put together and what parts were 
</tt><tt>within the black plastic casing.  I wrote about that experience at the 
</tt><tt>time - in 1999 - as follows:
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

&quot;More Like a Printing Press!&quot;

</pre><tt>I changed the toner cartridge in my Hewlett Packard 6L LaserJet printer 
</tt><tt>on Saturday, and yesterday I got to thinking about what was inside the 
</tt><tt>&quot;cartridge&quot;, so after removing the only two screws I could find on it, I 
</tt><tt>half opened... and then fully broke it open and took it apart.  Inside, 
</tt><tt>other than prodigious amounts of left-over toner power (don't try this 
</tt><tt>inside!), there were three rollers, the largest being the lightest, 
</tt><tt>about one inch in diameter and coated with... something that is a very 
</tt><tt>nice greenish turquoise color.  Another (smaller diameter) roller is 
</tt><tt>quite heavy, and is a magnet (it sticks to the refrigerator...).  I was 
</tt><tt>contemplating how to get the third roller out, but as I turned the 
</tt><tt>cartridge one way and the other, piles of toner began puffing out here 
</tt><tt>and there, so I gave up on that and was about to put it in a plastic bag 
</tt><tt>when a gust of wind blew toner all over me....  Fast loosing enthusiasm 
</tt><tt>for further exploration, I hurriedly stuffed the main cartridge in the 
</tt><tt>plastic bag I had, and began to clean up the toner that had spilled over 
</tt><tt>the edges of the paper I had laid out (I was at least rudimentarily 
</tt><tt>prepared for toner leaks).  Happily, the mess wasn't actually too 
</tt><tt>difficult to clean up.  The toner brushed off of my clothes, and the 
</tt><tt>toner on the concrete of the balcony cleaned up with wet paper towels 
</tt><tt>fairly easily.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>It was a mess, but I'm glad I went to the trouble.  The setup within the 
</tt><tt>cartridge looks like that of an offset printing press; more complicated 
</tt><tt>than I had imagined.  The general reliability of modern machinery 
</tt><tt>requires little thinking about the inner workings of it, but when you 
</tt><tt>can see the technology, the way you can with the mechanical gears and 
</tt><tt>rollers in a printing press, you have more respect for the complexity of 
</tt><tt>it.  The trouble with our very complex computers is that the complex 
</tt><tt>circuitry of computer chips is virtually invisible, and thus less 
</tt><tt>appreciated.  I suppose that instead of getting bent out of shape too 
</tt><tt>much when our technology doesn't work, we should appreciate it when it 
</tt><tt>does...
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">


</pre><tt>Back to the cause of the paper feed going bad... the only thing that 
</tt><tt>comes to mind is the air... I once bought some old enlarging equipment 
</tt><tt>from a guy who used to live in Los Angeles, California, and he claimed 
</tt><tt>that the rubber parts were in bad condition due to the polluted air in 
</tt><tt>LA (we were up in Northern California at the time of the conversation).  
</tt><tt>Since the rubber feed rollers on the old machines that I've broken down 
</tt><tt>have had a damaged surface (hard to explain exactly, the surface looks 
</tt><tt>slightly different and isn't as smooth as it was when the machines were 
</tt><tt>new), I have to wonder if that could be cause rubber degenerating faster 
</tt><tt>than it should.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>In any case, there is still a way to use my Epson LP-900 - I put in 
</tt><tt>about ten sheets at a time, and then when I print something, I lightly 
</tt><tt>rest a finger on the edge of the paper sitting in the feed tray, and 
</tt><tt>just after the first page is pulled in (with several pages below it 
</tt><tt>pulled in slightly (a half centimeter or so - further in than they 
</tt><tt>should be), I forcibly pull the paper out and realign it before it gets 
</tt><tt>sucked into the machine as one bunch.  With each sheet of paper printed, 
</tt><tt>I repeat that.  It's not something I should have to do, and I never had 
</tt><tt>to when the machine was new, but it beats (for now anyway) having to buy 
</tt><tt>a new printer and for the time being - when operated that way - it 
</tt><tt>almost never jams.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">


Even Plugs?!

</pre><tt>I've added a couple of internal bits to one of my computers, requiring 
</tt><tt>internal DC power connections, so I solved the lack of internal extra 
</tt><tt>plugs by buying an adaptor that plugs in between the power supply and 
</tt><tt>the hard drive.  It worked fine, with the caveat that the female side of 
</tt><tt>the plugs are tighter and the male-side pins seem to be of a larger 
</tt><tt>diameter than the originals.  Not a big deal, as it's still possible to 
</tt><tt>plug them in and even (with more effort) to unplug them.  All fine and 
</tt><tt>good, but today I tried to plug in an accessory adaptor cable for yet 
</tt><tt>another device that needs internal DC power (a USB 2.0 / IEEE 1394 
</tt><tt>board), but the new plug wouldn't go into the adaptor cable I put in 
</tt><tt>previously, and it wouldn't connect!  I tried to force it, but it just 
</tt><tt>wasn't going in, so I finally rearranged things so the two new cables 
</tt><tt>didn't have to be connected with each other, but even then, the first 
</tt><tt>attempt at connecting an old plug to one of the new female connections 
</tt><tt>pushed the pins out of the plug case!  I was able to shove them back in 
</tt><tt>and (supporting the wires in back this time) get all four of the pins 
</tt><tt>plugged in that way... but I got into a slightly stormy frame of mind at 
</tt><tt>one point.  Just plugging in a cable shouldn't require that much effort!
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>All of that said, I should add that getting into the old OptiPlex 
</tt><tt>computer was a breeze, and getting the new board plugged in only 
</tt><tt>required bending the metal end piece back slightly so the board would 
</tt><tt>line up correctly with the slot it needed to plug into.
