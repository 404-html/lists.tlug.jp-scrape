&gt;
&gt; Man, you've been skimping on your reading then.  Start with The
&gt; Mythical Man-Month and read between the lines to realize just how
&gt; SNAFU-ed IBM development practices were in the 50s and early 60s (and
&gt; they achieved World Domination and Fred Brooks got to be Monday
&gt; Morning Quarterback for Life, so it worked out OK ;-).  Then go on to
&gt; Ed Yourdon's &quot;Decline and Fall of the American Programmer&quot; to find out
&gt; just how bad the U.S. industry sucked in the late 80s/early 90s, and
&gt; then his &quot;Resurrection and Rise of the American Programmer&quot;, in which
&gt; Eddie-kun discovers in 1999 or so that the rest of the world sucks
&gt; just as bad, so the U.S. still has a chance.  (Incidently, after
&gt; getting multiple accolades for &quot;world-class software development
&gt; organizations&quot; in D &amp; F, Japan is reduced to a single footnote in R &amp;
&gt; R!  Sad, sad, sad.)
&gt;
&gt; Executive summary: While things are horrible now, they could be worse.
&gt; And frequently have been.  :-|


I've read &quot;Mythical Man-Month&quot;, but not any of the others.  Perhaps
I'll look up some of those books -- thanks!

But, I have this feeling that the &quot;next&quot; generation of programmers
(i.e., who have just graduated or are in their 20s and make up many of
the small-to-medium sized vendors) are not learning lessons like this.

I fear that the current CS curriculums have traded such useful content
for more &quot;practical&quot; courses such as iOS and Android programming.  I
guess it's good that they learn skills for app programming, but I
wonder if their foundation is weaker.

And yes, things could have been worse but what bothers me is that they
are passing technical decisions on to the customers/clients under the
guise of &quot;customer's always right&quot; / &quot;customer's the boss&quot;.
Ok...sure...so why are we paying you for your IT skills?

Something doesn't look right and it's the lessons mentioned in those
books and something else that I can't seem to grasp.


&gt;  &gt; [*]  Yes, it could be a problem with the companies we were
&gt;  &gt; approaching.  We didn't have a lot of money so we could not
&gt;  &gt; approach large vendors -- only small/medium sized ones.
&gt;
&gt; The large ones are often worse, at least in Japan.  The problem is
&gt; that they don't do very much programming in-house, they farm it out to
&gt; subcontractors, which tend to farm it out to subcontractors, which


I don't know about that.  Honestly, we didn't have the funds to pay
larger vendors to compare.  And I think few will have the resources to
pay two vendors for a project to compare.  In the end, you pick one
based on the quotation they give you...and we all know how misleading
(i.e., the fine print) those quotations can have!


&gt; ....  And since all you've got is management and &quot;systems integrators&quot;
&gt; in the chain, who don't actually do design or coding, they jealously
&gt; guard the communications channels and their level of requirements
&gt; documents, effectively preventing the actual programmers from ever
&gt; learning, let alone serving, the actual client's needs. :-(  And of
&gt; course at the very top end of the scale, they want to sell you a
&gt; &quot;cloud solution&quot;, not the software itself.  Which is a completely
&gt; different can of worms, and the only problem that a can of worms can
&gt; solve for you is composting.


*ugh*  Don't get me started on how often I've been hearing about the
&quot;cloud&quot;. Most people that use the term don't know what it means and
use it to demonstrate they are up-to-date...


&gt; That's why when I have a friend who needs software written, I
&gt; introduce them to Curt (wow, was that really 10 years ago?) or one of
&gt; the other one/two-man shops with serious OCD I know of.  Of course
&gt; there are large projects that require more than such a shop can do by
&gt; itself in time, but largish companies tend to delude themselves that
&gt; everything they do is big, whereas in fact many of their tasks are
&gt; small enough that a lone independent contractor can do them better,
&gt; faster, *and* cheaper.  You do have to pick the right contractor....


Yes, it would be nice if I had contractors on hand to approach that I
trust.  Getting the wrong contractor is possibly worse than doing it
yourself since you spend so much time checking what they're doing.

I've returned to academia so, for the moment, I don't need to worry
about seeking vendors...


&gt; P.S. I was at a talk today where the lecturer put up a chart showing
&gt; that the *pay* rankings in Japan for several languages was headed by
&gt; Python, Perl, Ruby, C/C++, Java (about a 10% hit vs Python), PHP,
&gt; Javascript, C#, Swift, and Objective-C (by now a 25% hit vs. Python).
&gt; I guess if you know two languages you can add the salaries? ;-)


Reminds me of this article in CACM's blogs:

<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/176450-python-is-now-the-most-popular-introductory-teaching-language-at-top-us-universities/fulltext">http://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/176450-python-is-now-the-most-popular-introductory-teaching-language-at-top-us-universities/fulltext</a>

I'm not sure if curriculum reflects the job market or vice-versa.
i.e., what influences what.

It would be interesting if such a study was done in Japan.  i.e., like
the table in the Appendix  Has anyone heard of one?
