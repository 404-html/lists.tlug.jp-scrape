Folks, I'm forwarding this message with the hope that perhaps someone
can help Mr. Kieslich.  

He's an ArchLinux developer (which I think is evident from his email) 
This is forwarded with his knowledge and permission.  Perhaps someone
could give him a link where there are plenty of Japanese pdf files to
test.  

(That part I can certainly give him of course--however, some of his other
questions are well beyond my knowledge.[1]   Also, I usually only need
Japanese for emails and a few web pages, never played with it with pdfs.)

Any answers can be made to Mr. Kieslich directly, or to me to forward to
him.  (Or to the list and I'll forward them to him from here, if the
poster feels it's of general interest.)


[1] Especially about fonts

I have directed him to my page, and the links it has, especially Dr.
Fabian's.

Hi Scott,

I hope it's ok to contact you due to this.

A guy on IRC asked me if I could provide some xpdf-i18n stuff. I thought
that would be a good idea. Now he doesn't show up at IRC any more so I
can't ask him if he could test my stuff.

I'm currently working to bring in these packages which are available
from the xpdf's homepage. Now, while things seem to work, also the
configure files are tweaked appropriate, I don't have any chance to test
these packages for the reason that I neither can read nor do understand
Japanese, traditional or simplified Chinese. I'm just stupid German
speaking some English and some long forgotten Russian. I also don't have
an idea where I could get some test pdf files to confirm the packages
are working correctly. Although I tried the new version at least
against a Olympus manual mixed Japanese/English, and it's better then
before. Now I hope you can help.

Pointing me to a file I can download or send me one would help a lot. I
also put my packages up to my server. If you like to test you will have
to install that t1lib, which is a new dependency that makes proper
displaying of Type1 fonts possible if they are installed and not
included in pdf. t1lib is also on my server only, it didn't make it into
the repos yet. Sorry.

www.justdreams.de/archlinux/downloads/xpdf
There you'll find pkgs and PKGBUILDS

There are also issues like the necessary fonts for proper displaying of
Japanese glyphs. Are there some fonts which are available as Type1 or
TTF since xpdf doesn't support X fonts any longer. Maybe there are
standard fonts coming with ghostscript or something, although fonts.dir
in that directory tells me all iso-8859-1. I don't know about MS-ttf
fonts capabilities of displaying Japanese glyphs. Currently I pointed
stuff to Vera fonts. If you can give me any tips about that, please let
me know.

Thanks.

Riley: Buffy . . . I feel like we've gotten really close. At 
least I thought we had. I don't know much about Angel or your 
relationship with him . . but . . . all I ask is . . if you're 
gonna break heart, do it fast. 
Buffy: What? You think that Angel and I...
Riley: Didn't you? 
Buffy: No. Of course not. How can you even ask me that? 
Riley: I don't know. Xander said... 
Buffy: Xander?! Oh, he's the deadest man in Deadonia.
