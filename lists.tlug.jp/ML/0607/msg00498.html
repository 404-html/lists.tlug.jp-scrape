[apologies if this appears twice--I sent it earlier from the wrong account]

</pre><tt>This really has nothing to do with Linux, but I know many of you are 
</tt><tt>interested in Japanese and Japanese dictionaries, and many of you also 
</tt><tt>are knowledgeable about Web design &amp; development, so I thought I'd let 
</tt><tt>you know about a little project I have begun, and solicit some feedback.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>To make a long story short, a couple of weeks ago I was looking for an 
</tt><tt>online Kanji dictionary, and couldn't find one I really liked. Or 
</tt><tt>rather, I couldn't find an *interface* I really liked. So I decided to 
</tt><tt>create my own. The site is intended to be fast, easy to navigate, and 
</tt><tt>aesthetically pleasing. The target audience is English-speaking learners 
</tt><tt>of Japanese (intermediate-to-advanced?), so the emphasis is on providing 
</tt><tt>easy access to phrases including the target kanji, readings, and 
</tt><tt>definitions--basically the kind of info you find in edict/jmdict. It 
</tt><tt>currently does not provide information of more scholarly interest, such 
</tt><tt>as Nelson index numbers and all that, though such info could maybe be 
</tt><tt>added later on as an &quot;advanced option.&quot;
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Another thing you should know is that my site makes heavy use of the 
</tt><tt>latest in Web-standard[*] technology. It is an AJAX application, so you 
</tt><tt>at least need a browser with JavaScript enabled, and that supports 
</tt><tt>XMLHttpRequest. So recent Gecko-based browsers should be fine, along 
</tt><tt>with IE 5.5+ (?) and Opera 8+. Since the whole point of the project is 
</tt><tt>to develop a nicer interface to content that is easily available 
</tt><tt>elsewhere, I don't feel obligated to create an alternative for older 
</tt><tt>browsers, but of course I provide links to other online Kanji dictionaries.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Here's the URL:  &lt;<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://matt.gushee.net:8250/index.html">http://matt.gushee.net:8250/index.html</a>&gt;. That's 
</tt><tt>probably temporary, so even if you really like it, please don't post any 
</tt><tt>links to it just yet. If you have comments and don't want to clutter 
</tt><tt>this list, just send an e-mail to &lt;matt@example.com&gt;.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">


SOME ISSUES TO CONSIDER
=======================

</pre><tt>First of all, the title. I am tentatively calling the thing &quot;&#x697D;&#x6F22;&#x6458;.&quot; I 
</tt><tt>like to think it's rather a clever pun, but if any native Japanese 
</tt><tt>speakers are reading this, I'd like to know how it sounds to you. Is it 
</tt><tt>just a wake-wakaranai gaijin joke? Please don't worry about offending 
</tt><tt>me--I will be happy to change the title if it is too weird.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Now on to more substantive issues:

Indexing approach
-----------------

</pre><tt>There will probably be several indexes in the future, but currently I 
</tt><tt>provide one way to look up Kanji: a traditional radical/stroke-count 
</tt><tt>index. Specifically, you select the radical stroke count, then the 
</tt><tt>radical itself, then the stroke count for the whole character, then the 
</tt><tt>specific character that you want. Although it is a linear process and 
</tt><tt>thus easy to understand in principle, it has the disadvantage that 
</tt><tt>people don't know by heart how many strokes are in a character, and it 
</tt><tt>can be very hard to figure out for the more complex ones. In a printed 
</tt><tt>dictionary it's less of a problem because you can easily shift your eyes 
</tt><tt>to another part of the page; in a browser I think it will be awkward at 
</tt><tt>best.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>What other alternatives might work well (when you don't know the 
</tt><tt>pronunciation)? I've seen Jim Breen's &quot;multi-radical&quot; method and was 
</tt><tt>initially resistant to it for a couple of reasons: first, it is 
</tt><tt>non-linear, and thus is superficially more complex than the 
</tt><tt>radicals/strokes method.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Second, I have been taught (for both Chinese and Japanese) that the 
</tt><tt>radical is the &quot;meaning&quot; component, and that in general a character has 
</tt><tt>exactly one radical. At any rate, I believe the radical has etymological 
</tt><tt>significance, and that understanding which part of the Kanji is the 
</tt><tt>radical can contribute to an overall mastery of the language. And a 
</tt><tt>single-radical dictionary index reinforces that understanding.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>But I'm thinking that a multi--can I say &quot;component&quot; instead of 
</tt><tt>&quot;radical&quot;?  Then maybe I could set aside the philosophical objection. 
</tt><tt>Anyway, a well-designed multi-thing index might after all be an easier 
</tt><tt>way to look up Kanji.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Strokes/radicals index navigation
---------------------------------

</pre><tt>If I decide to go to a multi-component index, this might not matter any 
</tt><tt>more. But for the moment, there is an issue with the index menus: in 
</tt><tt>view of the fact that the user will often not be sure how many strokes 
</tt><tt>there are in a character, I have created dynamic menus such that ... 
</tt><tt>actually it's best if you try it out. Basically, if you move your mouse 
</tt><tt>over an item in one row of the menu, the next row is *temporarily* 
</tt><tt>displayed. Thus, let's say you have chosen a given radical. There is a 
</tt><tt>row of numbers representing stroke counts of characters with that 
</tt><tt>radical; if you run your mouse along that row you can easily see what 
</tt><tt>characters exist for each stroke count.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>So, do you think this is (a) useful, and (b) intuitive? It would be a 
</tt><tt>lot easier to make the menus so that the next row only changes when you 
</tt><tt>click something. But if people find the transient display a very helpful 
</tt><tt>feature, I will make it work.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Presentation of results
-----------------------

</pre><tt>Currently when you select a Kanji, a request goes to the server, which 
</tt><tt>returns a document containing all phrases that start with that Kanji. 
</tt><tt>This document is dumped into a table with 3 columns: [Kanji] Phrase, 
</tt><tt>Reading, and Definitions. This is reasonable in some cases, but 
</tt><tt>sometimes the response document is quite large, so I think some kind of 
</tt><tt>chunking and/or filtering would be helpful. It gets worse if we want to 
</tt><tt>look up all phrases *containing* the selected character. My server-side 
</tt><tt>script can indeed do that, but sometimes it's just way too much data, so 
</tt><tt>I've disabled that behavior for the moment.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Another issue with the result sets is that they're not sorted in any 
</tt><tt>useful way--actually I believe they are ordered according to the JMdict 
</tt><tt>entry sequence number.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

So, how can I improve the processing and presentation of the results?

Miscellaneous technical stuff
-----------------------------

</pre><tt>Preparing the index: my list of radicals is derived from Jim Breen's 
</tt><tt>KANJIDIC, but since his data is prepared for a multi-radical lookup 
</tt><tt>system, I can't automatically extract a radicals-and-strokes index, so I 
</tt><tt>am currently creating the index manually. That's why it's so incomplete, 
</tt><tt>of course. Does anyone know of another database somewhere that list each 
</tt><tt>kanji by (single) radical and stroke count?
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Glyphs for radicals: if my understanding of the KANJIDIC documentation 
</tt><tt>is correct, there is a glyph of each radical in Japanese Kanji, but some 
</tt><tt>of them only exist in JISX-0212. If so, you either have to require the 
</tt><tt>user to have a JISX-0212 font, use images to represent some radicals, or 
</tt><tt>use substitute glyphs from JISX-0208. The last option is not really 
</tt><tt>acceptable, I don't think. E.g., &#x5316; for &#x4EBA;&#x504F;??
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Nice Japanese font: this is purely subjective, of course, but I find 
</tt><tt>Mincho rather ugly. I have a font family called DFKaisho which I find to 
</tt><tt>be an excellent combination of elegance and readability; my stylesheet 
</tt><tt>specifies it for some of the Kanji display elements (with &quot;serif&quot; as a 
</tt><tt>fallback, of course). But in the interest of a more beautiful 
</tt><tt>Kanji-browsing experience, are there other Kaisho or similar fonts that 
</tt><tt>are widely used? Let me know their names and I'll stick 'em in the 
</tt><tt>stylesheet. Or tell me to just use Mincho if that's your view. But be 
</tt><tt>advised: I am very stubborn about fonts.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">
