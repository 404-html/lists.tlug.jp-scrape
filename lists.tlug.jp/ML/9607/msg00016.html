Hi all,

This showed up in my mail yesterday and thought you might want to see it. I
checked my cookie and found nothing from them - read on.... 

&gt;I found this post in a www-security mailing list. I thought this
&gt;list would benefit from it too. Comments?
&gt;
&gt;

&gt;Forwarded message:
&gt;| Date:         Wed, 26 Jun 1996 19:42:00 -0700
&gt;| From: Scott Wyant &lt;scott_wyant@example.com&gt;
&gt;| Subject:      COMMENT: Cookie dough
&gt;| To: Multiple recipients of list ADV-HTML &lt;ADV-HTML@example.com&gt;
&gt;| 
&gt;| (I originally posted this to a library science listserve, and was asked to
&gt;| post it here.  I hope it is of some interest to ADV-HTML readers)
&gt;| 
&gt;| This list has seen discussion about the little "cookie" that a Netscape
&gt;| server hands to your browser.  Have you wondered how someone might use it to
&gt;| make some money?
&gt;| 
&gt;| Here's how.
&gt;| (This will take a while, but I think it's worth it.)
&gt;| 
&gt;| Using Find File, look for a file called cookie.txt (or MagicCookie if you
&gt;| have a Mac machine).  Using a text editor, open the file and take a look.
&gt;|  If you've been doing any browsing, the odds are about 80/20 that you'll find
&gt;| a cookie in there from someone called "doubleclick.net."
&gt;| 
&gt;| If you're like me, you never went to a site called "doubleclick."  So how did
&gt;| they give you a cookie?  After all, the idea of the cookie, according to the
&gt;| specs published by Netscape, is to make a more efficient connection between
&gt;| the server the delivers the cookie and the client machine which receives it.
&gt;| But we have never connected to "doubleclick."
&gt;| 
&gt;| Close MagicCookie, connect to the Internet, and jump to &lt;www.doubleclick.net&gt;
&gt;|  Read all about how they are going to make money giving us cookies we don't
&gt;| know about, collecting data on all World Wide Web users, and delivering
&gt;| targeted REAL TIME marketing based on our cookies and our profiles.
&gt;| 
&gt;| Pay special attention to the information at:
&gt;| &lt;www.doubleclick.net/advertising/howads.htm&gt;
&gt;| 
&gt;| You'll see that the folks at "doubleclick" make the point that this entire
&gt;| transaction (between their server and your machine) is "transparent to the
&gt;| user."  In plain English, that means you'll never know what hit you.
&gt;| 
&gt;| So what's happening is, subscribers to the doubleclick service put a "cookie
&gt;| request" on their home page FOR THE DOUBLECLICK COOKIE.  When you hit such a
&gt;| site, it requests the cookie and take a look to see who you are, and any
&gt;| other information in your cookie file.  It then sends a request to
&gt;| "doubleclick" with your ID, requesting all available marketing information
&gt;| about you.  (They're very coy about where this information comes from, but it
&gt;| seems clear that at least some of it comes from your record of hitting
&gt;| "doubleclick" enabled sites.)  You then receive specially targetted marketing
&gt;| banners from the site.  In other words, if Helmut Newton and I log on to
&gt;| the same site at the exact same time, I'll see ads for wetsuits and
&gt;| basketballs, and Helmut will see ads for cameras.
&gt;| 
&gt;| If you log in to a "doubleclick" enabled site, and it sends a request for
&gt;| your "doubleclick" cookie, and you don't have one, why each and every one of
&gt;| those sites will hand you a "doubleclick" cookie.
&gt;| 
&gt;| Neat, huh?  And you can bet they're going to be rolling in the cookie dough.
&gt;| Me, I edit my cookie file each and every time I go to a new site.  (Despite
&gt;| the dire warning at the top of the file, you can edit it with no adverse
&gt;| consequences.)
&gt;| 
&gt;| Oh, and one other thing.  If you edit your cookie file BEFORE you connect to
&gt;| "doubleclick," and then jump around at the site, you'll notice that they
&gt;| DON'T hand you a cookie.  I probed the site pretty carefully, checking the
&gt;| MagiCookie file, and nothing happened.
&gt;| 
&gt;| Until I closed Netscape.  The LAST thing the 'doubleclick" site did was....
&gt;| You guesed it.  They handed me a cookie.  So much for making the
&gt;| client-server negotiation more efficient.  (In fairness, that cookie may
&gt;| have been in memory until I closed Netscape -- I can't tell for sure.)
&gt;| Scott Wyant
&gt;| Spinoza Ltd.
&gt;
&gt;Note that recent versions of Netscape have an option to "show an alert
&gt;before accepting a cookie" which can be turned on in the Network
&gt;Preferences/Protocols menu.
