This type of scheme is not new, it's been used by Prodigy and AOL before to 
get even more info. or profiles about users.

If you don't want to get profiled, don't surf the net.  If you don't want to 
get spammed, don't post to newsgroups.  There is no such thing as being 
anonymous on the net.

Hi all,

This showed up in my mail yesterday and thought you might want to see it. I
checked my cookie and found nothing from them - read on.... 

&gt;I found this post in a www-security mailing list. I thought this
&gt;list would benefit from it too. Comments?
&gt;
&gt;

&gt;| Date:         Wed, 26 Jun 1996 19:42:00 -0700
&gt;| From: Scott Wyant &lt;scott_wyant@example.com&gt;
&gt;| Subject:      COMMENT: Cookie dough
&gt;| To: Multiple recipients of list ADV-HTML &lt;ADV-HTML@example.com&gt;
&gt;| 
&gt;| (I originally posted this to a library science listserve, and was asked 
to
&gt;| post it here.  I hope it is of some interest to ADV-HTML readers)
&gt;| 
&gt;| This list has seen discussion about the little "cookie" that a Netscape
&gt;| server hands to your browser.  Have you wondered how someone might use it 
to
&gt;| make some money?
&gt;| 
&gt;| Here's how.
&gt;| (This will take a while, but I think it's worth it.)
&gt;| 
&gt;| Using Find File, look for a file called cookie.txt (or MagicCookie if you
&gt;| have a Mac machine).  Using a text editor, open the file and take a look.
&gt;|  If you've been doing any browsing, the odds are about 80/20 that you'll 
find
&gt;| a cookie in there from someone called "doubleclick.net."
&gt;| 
&gt;| If you're like me, you never went to a site called "doubleclick."  So how 
did
&gt;| they give you a cookie?  After all, the idea of the cookie, according to 
the
&gt;| specs published by Netscape, is to make a more efficient connection 
between
&gt;| the server the delivers the cookie and the client machine which receives 
it.
&gt;| But we have never connected to "doubleclick."
&gt;| 
&gt;| Close MagicCookie, connect to the Internet, and jump to 
&lt;www.doubleclick.net&gt;
&gt;|  Read all about how they are going to make money giving us cookies we 
don't
&gt;| know about, collecting data on all World Wide Web users, and delivering
&gt;| targeted REAL TIME marketing based on our cookies and our profiles.
&gt;| 
&gt;| Pay special attention to the information at:
&gt;| &lt;www.doubleclick.net/advertising/howads.htm&gt;
&gt;| 
&gt;| You'll see that the folks at "doubleclick" make the point that this 
entire
&gt;| transaction (between their server and your machine) is "transparent to 
the
&gt;| user."  In plain English, that means you'll never know what hit you.
&gt;| 
&gt;| So what's happening is, subscribers to the doubleclick service put a 
"cookie
&gt;| request" on their home page FOR THE DOUBLECLICK COOKIE.  When you hit 
such a
&gt;| site, it requests the cookie and take a look to see who you are, and any
&gt;| other information in your cookie file.  It then sends a request to
&gt;| "doubleclick" with your ID, requesting all available marketing 
information
&gt;| about you.  (They're very coy about where this information comes from, 
but it
&gt;| seems clear that at least some of it comes from your record of hitting
&gt;| "doubleclick" enabled sites.)  You then receive specially targetted 
marketing
&gt;| banners from the site.  In other words, if Helmut Newton and I log on to
&gt;| the same site at the exact same time, I'll see ads for wetsuits and
&gt;| basketballs, and Helmut will see ads for cameras.
&gt;| 
&gt;| If you log in to a "doubleclick" enabled site, and it sends a request for
&gt;| your "doubleclick" cookie, and you don't have one, why each and every one 
of
&gt;| those sites will hand you a "doubleclick" cookie.
&gt;| 
&gt;| Neat, huh?  And you can bet they're going to be rolling in the cookie 
dough.
&gt;| Me, I edit my cookie file each and every time I go to a new site.  
(Despite
&gt;| the dire warning at the top of the file, you can edit it with no adverse
&gt;| consequences.)
&gt;| 
&gt;| Oh, and one other thing.  If you edit your cookie file BEFORE you connect 
to
&gt;| "doubleclick," and then jump around at the site, you'll notice that they
&gt;| DON'T hand you a cookie.  I probed the site pretty carefully, checking 
the
&gt;| MagiCookie file, and nothing happened.
&gt;| 
&gt;| Until I closed Netscape.  The LAST thing the 'doubleclick" site did 
was....
&gt;| You guesed it.  They handed me a cookie.  So much for making the
&gt;| client-server negotiation more efficient.  (In fairness, that cookie may
&gt;| have been in memory until I closed Netscape -- I can't tell for sure.)
&gt;| Scott Wyant
&gt;| Spinoza Ltd.
&gt;
&gt;Note that recent versions of Netscape have an option to "show an alert
&gt;before accepting a cookie" which can be turned on in the Network
&gt;Preferences/Protocols menu.
