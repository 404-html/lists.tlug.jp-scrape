&gt; Hello my name is Phil Hilton

Hi, Phil.

&gt; I am sending this email out as I need to obtain a decent laptop and I have
&gt; not a clue who gives the best deals in Tokyo. I have had a look around most
&gt; of the big places in Aikihabra and did not think value that they were very
&gt; competetivly priced.

I would have to agree.

&gt; Excuse my ignorance its the first time I have bothered with mobile
&gt; computing believing laptops to be overpriced underpowered toys. Also I am
&gt; distrustfull of anything I can't take the back off and stuff with PCI
&gt; cards.

Let me express my joy that you are coming over to the mobile world. It's nice 
here.

&gt; What I am looking for is a good box with an english bios, a dual language
&gt; keyboard and all the trimmings. I really want to try out wireless networks
&gt; as I am aware that many wifi nets for the internet cafes are unencrypted
&gt; and this would be a cheap way to check my email on weekends......I know
&gt; using someone elses access is a bit cheeky but this Tokyo  I am just
&gt; starting out here.....AND EVERYTHING IS FREAKIN' EXPENSIVE. I may soon be
&gt; out on the streets doing favours for sailors to make ends meet......and I
&gt; don't mean sowing on buttons or darning socks.

Actually being a sailor, (USN), I'd like to say, firstly, thanks but no 
thanks. Secondly, I've been pondering the wifi entry plan too. I'm plotting 
on how to make a weatherproof wifi repeater. Preferably camoflagued, so I can 
hang it from a tree.

&gt; Back on the case Dell has been recommended to me as component quality is
&gt; good........but I am being seduced by Vaio. However, I hear that Sony uses
&gt; intergrated Sis chipsets which I have great contempt for....

Dells are great. But Vaio's... Vaio's are just plain damn sexy. I use a Vaio 
Picturebook for all my needs. Split Slackware and WinXP (winxp has been 
booted twice.) I absolutely love mine. If it had breasts and a more forgiving 
PCMCIA slot... well, I get ahead of myself.

&gt; I know this is a lot to ask but if anyone knows there way around the new
&gt; portable posing pieces please shout me back. Are the new compaqs any good I
&gt; know screen quality used to be poor on them have they sorted this yet?

HPaq's are decent, I suppose. My guru has a HPaq running Linux nicely.

&gt; Any help you could give me would be good.

My honest advice? As much as we are in the center of the technological 
universe... Import. The shipping may suck, but you'll have somthing you can 
take back with you. You can always go out and buy a Japanese keyboard at a 
later date and time. And Japanese capabilities... well, that's what the rest 
of this list is around for. Try this joint: 
www.linuxcertified.com/linux_laptops.html  Cheapish. Stylin' too. Also, 
www.affordablecomputers.com ... both these places will actually ship with 
Linux pre-installed. I'm not sure about customs and everything, though, 
because, generally, I don't have to deal with it.

Regards,
Christian, the token Sailor
