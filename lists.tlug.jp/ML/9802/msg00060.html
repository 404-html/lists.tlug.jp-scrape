Hi,
this is the draft I plan to send out to the lists and newsgroups
tomorrow.  Due to timing, maybe we should go to the Chinese
restaurant.

		       TLUG February 14 Meeting
		       ------------------------

All Linux lovers in the Kanto area are invited to attend
the February 14th Tokyo Linux Users Group meeting.  Membership
is open to anyone.  There are currently no membership dues.

TLUG is a non-profit, non-political organization established 
in June of 1994 to exchange information on the use of Linux 
and Free Software Foundation tools.  TLUG has an active
mailing list, home page, and regular physical meetings.  
Discussions are primarily held in English.  However, 
everyone is welcome to attend.  We especially want to encourage
Japanese people to attend and will make efforts to 
support a bilingual meeting.  

The TLUG home page is available at
	<A TARGET="_top" HREF="http://www.twics.com/~tlug/">http://www.twics.com/~tlug/</A>

Notes of the January 14th drinking party, including pictures of some
of the members are available at
	<A TARGET="_top" HREF="http://www.twics.com/~tlug/9801/index.html">http://www.twics.com/~tlug/9801/index.html</A>

Pictures and notes of the December 13 meeting, including pictures
of the meeting place at the station and the Chinese restaurant
we're going to are at:

-------

Most of the benefit of the meeting comes 
from chatting with other Linux users and having informal 
discussions.  Lunch is one of the main reasons for going 
to the meetings for many people.  Everyone is expected 
to pay for their own meal.

    ** Make Friends **


We will be meeting at Tokyo station on February 14th, Saturday
in front of the Tokyo station Yaesu central ticket gate at 12:30.
There is more than one Yaesu ticket gate, so be careful.  If you
know you are going and don't know what we look like, send
me an e-mail (craig@example.com) and I'll make sure we wait 
for you.  After everyone gathers, we'll walk down the stairs 
and have lunch in the restaurant area in the basement of 
Tokyo station.  If you're late or can't find us, your second chance is
to hang out at Starbucks at 13:30.  After a cup of coffee
we'll walk over to Joe Marchak's office.  

  **** Learn about the latest cutting edge technology **** 

We have two unstructured demonstrations by TLUG members

  ***************************************
  **** CD-ROM Burning with XCD-Roast ****
  ***************************************

Joe Marchak will give a brief demonstration of XCD-Roast.
We plan to make an initial Linux CD.  We are collecting
media for the CD.  We don't have an Internet connection,
so bring your data on floppy disks.  

Here is what Joe has to say about the media event:

&gt; I'll provide some blanks.  We can make CD's with the TLUG Archives,
&gt; Webpages, Yudit, XCDRoast and whatever anyone brings to the meeting.  If
&gt; we collect Y200 for each burned, it will pay for the blanks.  If people
&gt; can bring material on CD, floppy, or ZIP disks, we can include it on the
&gt; burn image as well.   It will take about 15 minutes for each burn, and
&gt; some time to put together an image.

 
 ****************************************************************
 *** Image Processing Techniques in Human-Computer Interfaces ***
 ****************************************************************

Researcher Dr. Alberto Tomita, Jr. now of a famous research
institution will give an overview of his research on image
processing techniques.  Dr. Tomita, was known as merely
Alberto the friendly grad student at the last meeting in December.  
Fortunately, this long-time TLUGer graduated and we can finally listen
to the working results of his research.  

This is what Alberto has to say about the demonstration:

&gt; The research is about using image processing techniques in human-computer
&gt; interfaces. It's divided in two parts. First, the photometric stereo method
&gt; (stereo vision with a single camera and multiple light sources) is used to 
&gt; estimate the orientation of the user's hand in the three-dimensional space.
&gt; Combined with other techniques, the processing flow provides a basis for 
&gt; the implementation of a gestural interface without using gloves.
&gt;
&gt; It will be hard to demonstrate this system, as it requires controlled
&gt; illumination. I'll only show a couple of slides and concentrate on the second
&gt; half. 
&gt;  
&gt; The second part is a joint-research with the MPT Communications Research Lab
&gt; <A TARGET="_top" HREF="http://www.crl.go.jp/st/st821/research/sikaku.html">http://www.crl.go.jp/st/st821/research/sikaku.html</A> (in japanese). It's a
&gt; hand shape recognition system for use in a Braille reader, in order to 
&gt; facilitate the operation of a GUI by a visually impaired person. The system
&gt; is currently able to recognize the position of the thumb and the rotation
&gt; of the hand, emulating a mouse button and a scroll bar, respectively.
&gt;
&gt; I'll bring the software we developed, a video camera and the Matrox Meteor
&gt; video capture board. I think I can also show some applications that are
&gt; included in the Linux Meteor driver.


Facilities and Equipment Overview
*********************************

At least the following hardware will be set up for demonstration.
    Sparc 2     "Sparky" Linux RedHat installed
    PPro 200    (the CDE machine) with Red Hat installed
    Pentium 100 "Deb-chan" with Debian installed (probably)
    Hub&amp;cables  

We may do a few installs.  Feel free to bring your own machine
or software.  People often bring their hard disks for an
install.  The meeting is usually unstructured.  

If you are coming to the meeting, join the mailing
list by sending e-mail to majordomo@example.com and
including

  subscribe tlug
  end

in the body of the message.  You can get a feeling for
what the group is like.
