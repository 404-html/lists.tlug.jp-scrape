  2.2.	Election of Officers

  The following people were elected as new TLUG officers:

  o  Joe Marchak

  o  John Little

  o  Ken Harada

  o  Jim Schweizer

  Craig is retaining his 6 month tenure for another few months.

  Officers are responsible for review and approval of allocation of club
  funds and setting the direction of TLUG.

  2.3.	Voting on Structure of Events

  Saturday will be a structured meeting with speakers.	Suggestions for
  topics and speakers will be solicited from TLUG members using the
  mailing list.

  Wednesday meetings will have an agenda as follows: 1) drink, 2) eat.

  2.4.	Demonstrations

  There were four main demonstrations.

  2.4.1.  human interface using a video grabber

  "Doc" Alberto Tomita	:-) explained his research in using Linux as the
  image processor to detect two and three dimensional movements using a
  single camera and two light sources.	He explained application of his
  research in using the system for blind people who were interacting
  with the computer with a braille reader.  The visually impaired person
  can click on the mouse and call up menus with hand movements over the
  braille reader.

  2.4.2.  Yudit unicode editor

  Gary Sinai, the author of Yudit, gave a demonstration of multi-lingual
  editing.  He showed the display and print output of about 5 languages
  on the same screen using free fonts.	Printing can be done on a
  standard English printer.

  2.4.3.  Turbo Linux Pro

  Scott Stone, of PHS,	demonstrated the installation and use of Turbo
  Linux Pro. The DPNote Japanese editor and the commercial Wnn6 Japanese
  input system were of special interest.

  2.4.4.  TLUG CD-ROM

  Joe Marchak, TLUG officer, used XCD Roast to create the first TLUG CD-
  ROM.	Tim Meggs won the CD in a contest.  We are still looking for
  lots and lots of media.

  2.5.	Prizes and Raffle

  We raffled out 3 white Red Hat t-shirts, 3 black RPM t-shirts, 3 Red
  Hat mouse pads, one Sparc ELC motherboard, 3 Linux Journals, and a
  Japanese keyboard.

  3.  Projects and Future Directions

  TLUG had thirty people attend the February meeting, the largest
  turnout ever.	The mailing list now as 139 active member and the
  digest has 23 members.  As TLUG grows in size, TLUGers are now
  thinking about how to contribute back to the Linux community.	Most
  TLUGers feel that Linux has give them so much and they want to give
  back and have fun doing it.  With the success of the group, we are now
  planning larger projects.  We aim to make the TLUG CD-ROM the best and
  most popular Linux User Group CD in the world.  TLUGers are also
  trying to publish books and journals to establish TLUG as the Linux
  Users Group with the best reputation in the world.  Tokyo is one of
  the most dynamic cities in the world and TLUG will be known as the
  Linux Users Group in the world.  It all starts with you, so volunteer
  to give back to the Linux community.

  3.1.	TLUG Server

  We are still trying to get a leased line to the Internet for the TLUG
  server.  Scott Stone is asking his company if we can drop the server
  on the Internet.  One use of the server will be to serve as a
  repository for the TLUG CD-ROM distribution.

  3.2.	TLUG CD-ROM Distribution

  This is a hot project.  We plan to roast media on to CD-ROMs, much of
  it multi-lingual or Japanese specific and a lot of the media will be
  original TLUG creations.  Joe Marchak is coordinating this right now,
  but we are looking for help.	We need a FTP repository to start
  collecting the media.

  3.3.	TLUG Library

  We are accepting donations for the TLUG library.  We loan out books
  and software for testing to members after they sign it out and promise
  to return what they check out.  Again, Joe Marchak is coordinating
  this, but we're looking for help.

  3.4.	The Perl Journal Japanese Edition

  TLUG is going to publish a Japanese version of the Perl Journal.  Joe
  Marchak and Ayako Kato are coordinating this project.	We are open to
  cooperation from any group.  Chris Sekiya is inquiring with the BSD
  group if they want to participate.

  The first meeting of the TLUG Perl Journal Project is scheduled for
  1998 Feb 28 at 13:30.	We're meeting at Omotesando kouban.
