Hi all,

Maybe I'm confused, but I thought the donations were to help pay for things
for the "group"?  If we start writing down how much each persons donates, do
we also start placing a price on the amount of time someone devotes or the
amount of software someone contributes to the group?  I don't think so.  I
have to agree with Craig that accounting for the funds is necessary, but as
to how much each person donates.....come on.....where are we going with
this?

I know many of you have donated time, knowledge, software, etc.  how do we
place a price on these things?  If it wasn't for a few of you "faithful and
devoted" members, we might not all have the opportunity to meet in the first
place.

Anyway, there is my two cents.

Blaine

&gt;&gt; This is interesting.
&gt;&gt; Mr. joem's opinion is different from Mr. Craig and his accountant
&gt;&gt; and from me.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Hi,
&gt;I don't think that the opinions are all that different.  I think
&gt;that my accountant wanted me to take better records so that
&gt;I wouldn't lose the money.  If I wrote down who donated how
&gt;much there would be less chance of me losing some coins in
&gt;my briefcase, especially after the large quantities of beer
&gt;that are common at these events.
&gt;
&gt;I'm quite willing to keep more accurate records of who
&gt;donated how much.  We actually did this for the
&gt;December meeting, because it was tied into the number of
&gt;raffle tickets.
&gt;
&gt;However, I don't think that the amount donated should be
&gt;tied into the amount of power that a vote carries.  Although,
&gt;it might be nice to give some generous people public recognition.
&gt;My opinion is that TLUG is a pretty simple group and the development
&gt;of Linux is successful because it treats a complex problem simply.
&gt;So, too much regulations may create too much work that no one will
&gt;volunteer to do.
&gt;
&gt;I don't understand the voting issue.  Could you define the
&gt;"yes" and "no" or other parameters of the vote?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Regards,
&gt;Craig
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; So I am hoping this could be an issue we can E-mail vote for when
&gt;&gt; it is implimented. Then a goal could be more clear at least to me.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Regards,
&gt;&gt; Kei.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; some members are actively participating in the particular projects,
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; working hard and contributing their resouces. I think those are also
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; accountted as goodwill in at least unit of time, So this gives budget
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; bases, reports. in case of failure, at least causes of failure will
be
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; known and accounted for.
&gt;&gt; &gt; .....
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; So in summary, I think that with a minimal of effort, we
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; keep better records of both time and monetary contributions.
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; However, I would tend to just list these on the web for
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; public record.  Complex systems that involve voting weight
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; based on donation might be too much, too soon.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; I think all of us at TLUG have the similar goals ... to promote the
&gt;&gt; &gt; production and availability of free software and to build a free
software
&gt;&gt; &gt; community in an as effective manner as possible.  The main theme has
&gt;&gt; &gt; generally been to use the software that others have given us, and to
give
&gt;&gt; &gt; back as much to the community as we as individuals have time and
resources
&gt;&gt; &gt; for.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; All of us make donations to TLUG in different ways ... some of us
&gt;&gt; &gt; financially, some of us by putting in a lot of time on projects, and
some
&gt;&gt; &gt; by just coming to the meetings and creating a good climate for others
to
&gt;&gt; &gt; enjoy.  All of these aspects are equally important.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; I personally would rather not keep lists on how much each person spends
&gt;&gt; &gt; on what project, or who gave how much money when, since it takes away
from
&gt;&gt; &gt; the atmosphere of freedom that exists at present.  Many people have
&gt;&gt; &gt; in the past given a great deal to TLUG without asking for anything in
&gt;&gt; &gt; return, and at the same time linux users with limited resources are as
&gt;&gt; &gt; much a valued part of TLUG as any other member.  I feel that this
&gt;&gt; &gt; atmosphere is what makes TLUG a special group.
