Well than maybe this isnt your typical gaijin house. Several of the
residents have Cable...me included (tv anyway) and some have ISDN. NO real
fuss at all. Of course, If I was living with a bunch of techno-geeks, we
would build a huge network ourselves. I dont want to be stuck having to do
everything to wire up somebody else's building!
You really think Wireless would be a viable option?!?

I think this started when I said that Jcom were not allowed to install in
our building...but I know full well that they are. If I rang the same
salesman that installed my TV, he would come in tomorrow and put my Internet
Cable in, hell he was desperately trying to do that when he was putting my
TV in, but I didnt have the money at the time.

Like I said, I wouldnt mind doing a project like wiring up a building...if I
was not doing it alone, and If I wasnt paying for all the parts, as I
inevitably would because no-one else would be interested. If they want the
internet, they already have it.

every chips in for an old pentium or something, and then install 
the free unix of your choice just to handle the proxying.  It
will probably never go down unless the hardware dies. You want
to take the harddrive out of the equation? Look at the linux router
project. Still to much stress? Get a cheap adsl router, and there
is nothing to maintain. Don't like to cable? thats what wireless is
for. If what I know about gaijin houses are correct all of these
solutions are better than trying to get multiple internet connections
in one of those places.  Cable and the like tend to depend on an ok
from the land lord, and for that matter so do multiple phone lines.

&gt; &gt; Cheers, thanks for the link. I just called them up and enquired about

&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps I don't understand the whole gaijin house setup*, but wouldn't
&gt; it be easier/cheaper to use a single account/dsl line and your choice of
