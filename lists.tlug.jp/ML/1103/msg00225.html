NGOs?

Sorry, I don't have any good suggestions. At the moment, there are
twoJapans.
The one I live in, which is experiencing mild to serious
inconvenience, and the one you're seeing on TV, which only trained
professionals are equipped to even get to, let alone do anything
helpful. Fortunately, the survivors do have reasonable shelter but
they're more or less isolated; the transportation system took a
really big hit, and the &quot;modern&quot; communication system, too. Ie,
cellphones are spotty touseless
throughout eastern Japan due to high demand and destruction of
towersand nodes.
Landlines and Internet seem fine if they work at all, though. Some
places can be reached only by helicopter and snowmobile, but those
are pretty rare. Trains are not yet running (as of noon today) in
Tohoku at all, and many roads are severed by landslides or bridge
collapses, or a few feet deep in mud and debris deposited by a
tsunami.

</pre><tt>Heck, there's even two Ibarakis.  In our Ibaraki, our power was restored 
</tt><tt>at 17:50 Sunday evening (13 MAR 11) and our Internet came back between 
</tt><tt>20:00~21:00 when we were eating dinner. We were without portable phone 
</tt><tt>service Saturday and Sunday and the only way to connect was to drive 
</tt><tt>about 14km south to Kashima.  I carried over 60 liters of water, fought 
</tt><tt>for toilet paper, waited for 90 minutes for 20 liters of &quot;haiokku,&quot; and 
</tt><tt>stood in line for over an hour for the right to buy JPY 3,000 of food 
</tt><tt>dragged out of a supermarket with a broken roof.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Hokota-shi received the second strongest level of the earthquake's
force but there is little obvious damage, especially when compared to
</pre><tt>areas adjoining us to the north and south. All of the local bridges are 
</tt><tt>now about 8~12 cm above their approaches and the newer bridges collapsed 
</tt><tt>or are closed as structurally unsound.  Our house is okay but the inside 
</tt><tt>looks like someone left it on &quot;frappe&quot; for about an hour. Everything 
</tt><tt>that was more than a meter above the floor wound up on top of it, 
</tt><tt>including all of our PCs, printers, and the bookshelves. We're still 
</tt><tt>moving around in cleared out spaces. They're predicting another 7.0 will 
</tt><tt>strike within 2~3 days, so none of us are too comfortable.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Physical damage wasn't severe compare to that suffered by our
neighboring towns despite the fact that they didn't get hit with as
</pre><tt>strong a shock.  Towns to the immediate north and south are unprotected 
</tt><tt>by bluffs and they suffered significant tsunami damage.  Go check out 
</tt><tt>the tsunami damage on Kokudou 124 along the big box strip in Kamisu for 
</tt><tt>an example of what a mess mud can make of a Uniclo, an Autobacs, or a 
</tt><tt>K's Denki.

Speaking of aftershocks, throughout this morning I was still feeling
them in Tsuchiura-shi (Ibaraki-ken).  I'm not feeling them in my
condo in Tsukuba, but it has the latest anti-quake structure.  I
imagine they continue, I just don't feel them through the building's
buffers.  I hope we're through the worst now, but the tsunami warning
is still up (although the whole Pacific coast is now at the &quot;listen
for news&quot; level instead of the &quot;get the heck out of there&quot; level),
and there were quakes severe enough to be announced by the early
warning network offshore at Sendai and Ibaraki-ken as recently as 6
hours ago.  Even geologically we're not back to normality yet.  The
good news is that the weather is gradually getting warmer.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>We're living in a building that used to be an izakaya in Taiyo-mura, 
</tt><tt>about halfway between Kashimanada and Kasumigaura ... salt water on one 
</tt><tt>side and fresh water on the other.  The only thing that stopped the 
</tt><tt>tsunamis here was the fact that we're sitting on top of a 30 meter bluff 
</tt><tt>and we only had a couple of hundred people to evacuate.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>I got to witness the first tsunami to hit Oarai's Golden Beach ... 5 
</tt><tt>meters high, traveling 800kph ... from Kokudou 51, about 100 meters 
</tt><tt>above the beach.  I was on my way to pick up my wife at her school in 
</tt><tt>Mito, 55 km from our house. The round trip, normally an hour each way, 
</tt><tt>took over eight hours over roads that looked like concrete waves with 
</tt><tt>lanes that had 15~20cm wide cracks and slabs that were almost 20cm 
</tt><tt>higher than the lane next to them.  Lots of guys in fast cars trying 
</tt><tt>quick lane changes around the turtles and winding up sliding on the roof 
</tt><tt>of their car for a couple of hundred meters.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>We've been pounded by aftershocks for hours on end.  The first ones were 
</tt><tt>in the neighborhood of 6-kyo and have run from 5-jakku down to just 
</tt><tt>barely perceptible since.  The dog (16kg of half Shiba-half Husky) is a 
</tt><tt>nervous wreck who howls every time the floor shakes and the cats are 
</tt><tt>obviously pissed off by his noise.

Maybe somebody else has some good suggestions, though.
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Ummm ... got a motorcycle license, experience riding enduro, woods, or 
</tt><tt>desert, (or Alpine / green lane in the UK or Europe) and have an 
</tt><tt>off-road bike in Japan?  There are  some local police agencies asking / 
</tt><tt>accepting help getting to the many small local settlements up and down 
</tt><tt>the coastal range that used to be small towns and are now just one or 
</tt><tt>two houses. Many are occupied by the elderly who need food, water, and 
</tt><tt>medicine and also need to be identified for evacuation. Many of 
</tt><tt>the&quot;modern&quot; roads are severely damaged or impassable and there are 
</tt><tt>places where riders are resorting to the old commercial footpaths that 
</tt><tt>criss-crossed the hills during the Heian~Bakumatsu eras but died out 
</tt><tt>from disuse in the early Restoration years. There are many one-two 
</tt><tt>family settlements around Kitaura and farther up the coast just a few 
</tt><tt>kilometers inland that used to be villages of several hundred.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Many occupants are elderly requiring regular kaigo service and who 
</tt><tt>cannot get out without assistance. Right now, local police are asking 
</tt><tt>for help from those of us who they know to own bikes and are 
</tt><tt>&quot;responsible&quot; (e.g. not bosozoku) but, some locales have police who 
</tt><tt>don't see or understand the need, yet.  Ibaraki Kenkei Honbu is grateful 
</tt><tt>for the offers but there is a certain amount of hand-wringing over 
</tt><tt>liability issues. The local junsa are completely swamped and like the 
</tt><tt>idea. YMMV, but you won't know until you try.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>I've seen some recommended NGOs on other lists, but I've never heard of 
</tt><tt>them ... and I'm always suspicious of groups I have never heard of even 
</tt><tt>more than the ones who advertise once an hour on TV.
