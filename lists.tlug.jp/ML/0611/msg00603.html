&gt; 
&gt; Here are my questions, in no particular order:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Where should I buy the puppy? I was thinking the Ginza Apple Store,
&gt; just so taking it back for service or whatever would be easy. I would
&gt; consider other options if they would save me a man or so.

	Depends.  How much is price an issue with you?  All Macs come
with a one year warranty provided by Apple so if the thing busts through
no actions of your own like say running it over with a Hummer so no
matter where you get it [1] you should have a 1 year warranty covered
by Apple.
	As for price, the variations tend to be very low unless you can
get an employee or student discount.  One advantage of buying at the
Apple store is availability.  If the Apple Store doesn't have it in stock
you're probably screwed everywhere else you go since that means there
is a stocking problem overall.  Like it or not, the Apple stores tend
to get preference when it comes to in-stock of Apple hardware.

&gt; 
&gt; 2. Is there an extended warranty offered by any vendor (especially the
&gt; Apple Store; see (1)), and is it worth buying? How much does it cost,
&gt; and how many additional years of warranty coverage does it confer?

	Apple offers an extended warranty called AppleCare.  It costs
around 3-4&#xE4;&#xE5; and is well worth it for a laptop if you are not the
upgrade every year type person.  The warranty lasts 3 years and covers
what I consider most important about the laptop, display replacement.

&gt; 
&gt; 3. I want to get a white model, but may want to upgrade the RAM at
&gt; purchase time. Is this an option? How much RAM should I need? I plan
&gt; to run the 'top in Linux most of the time, but there are a few things
&gt; I want to keep OS X around for (see below).

	If you can get away with it 2 gigs is good.  Run with at least
1 gig if you're planning on to run OS X for serious purposes.  If you're
going to spend most of your time in Linux it's basically an Intel box so
you should have an idea of your memory needs :-)
	One thing I would suggest is shop around and make sure the memory
you get is approved for running on Apple hardware.  Some memory vendors
try to skimp around and from my experience, Apple hardware will not
forgive you for buying shoddy memory. Having said that, buying memory
from Apple is quite expensive from my personal experience and I always
prefer to post-fit the memory on my own as the savings is well 
justified.

&gt; 
&gt; 4. Which applications, if any, come bundled with the Macbook? I have
&gt; some interest in Garage Band, and a lot of interest in iMovie or
&gt; whatever Apple is calling their video editing software these days. If
&gt; these apps do not come bundled, is there any cost advantage to buying
&gt; them together with the Macbook itself?

	iLife which indlues iMovie, Garage Band, iPhoto, iDVD and the
ilk is usually bundled with a new Mac purchase.  I consider them a very
good value as bundled software.  It saves a lot of time trying to find
tools that do the same thing in Windoze, Linux and Plan 9.
	
	If you're truly wanting more power you can always purchase
Final Cut Pro/Express, Shake and all their other professional multimedia
editing tools.  From my experience, unless Apple has some special sale
going on, you rarely get a cost savings buying the software with the Mac.

&gt; 
&gt; 5. Are there any accessories I will really want? I think I am covered
&gt; in the carrying case / laptop bag department. And no, I a) do not
&gt; consider the iPod an accessory, and b) will not be purchasing one.
&gt; Ever.

	If I remember correctly, all new Macs come with the remote
control so you can control it via the Front Row software that is probably
part of OS X as well. So you won't need that.
	One thing I can think off the top of my head is a plastic cover 
to protect the display screen.  I've found spending ~1000Y a decent 
bargain for avoiding the gunk and potential scratches that will 
accumulate on the display over time.

&gt; 
&gt; 6. Are there any questions I forgot to ask? ;)

Q: Does Linux run on the new Macbooks with Core2Duo with little problems?
A: I have no clue.  Let me know since I'm curious to hear too  :)

Q: Will it get viruses?
A: Not according to that commercial [2]

Q: Will the black model make me a Sith Lord?
A: Use the force, Luke.

[snip]
&gt; would be most indebted, and you *know* that I repay my debts in beers
&gt; at the bonenkai! :)

	There aren't enough beers in the world  ;-)

[1]  I'm pretty sure the 1 year warranty also doesn't come with Apple hardware
     that you purchase from the back of a van with some shady looking guy
     saying he found them real 'cheap'
